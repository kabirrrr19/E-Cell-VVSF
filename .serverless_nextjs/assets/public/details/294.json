Our bras are designed differently for different sizes of breasts, tested on all surgery types. From asymmetrical breasts to the ones that just recovered from a surgery or those undergoing one, our bras are the answers! Made of buttery-soft fabric, this recovery bra features comfortable compression, front opening, and a wide cushioned back-bridge for added support. We know that women want to feel as normal as possible, which is why they have worked hard to create bras that look just as good as they feel—from lacy bralettes to everyday picks, and can fit her new, altered body perfectly. Worth noting that the bra has pockets that can accommodate expanders, prosthesis, or breast forms, but also lays smoothly when nothing is in the pockets. Sugarshell may have been born out of necessity, but today it gives us a reason to celebrate what makes us different. Soft on the skin, Sugarshell is the most comfortable wear one can opt for their intimate needs. True to its name, it is the “sweetest shell or the cover” for the breasts so far!!!</p><p><br></p><p>Dealing with cancer is a life-changing event for most people. The symptoms and side effects may take a toll on both body and mind. At this stage, one gets to decide how she wants to live the rest of her life - live with hope or hand it to destiny. For many, it can be a time to minimize regrets and make new priorities. Priorities like ditching old habits and making more healthy and informed choices. At Sugarshell, we celebrate such C- warriors and work hard to offer them a range of intimate wears that look just as good as they feel. Because we believe, post-surgery bras don't have to be ugly! We are committed to being an impactful part of women's health, long-lasting comfort, and a one-stop solution that can fit her new, altered body perfectly. With Sugarshell, redefine you and re-build confidence.\"</p>","industries":["Textiles & Apparel"],"name":"SUGAR SHELL BRANDS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Apparel & Accessories"]},{"email":"info@exicom.co.in","idea":"<p>Exicom Technologies (India) LLP an Indian Company provides customised solutions in the field of covert operations, surveillance, security etc. Under Make in India initiative. \n</p><p>Exicom is a manufacturer of Video Airborne Downlink Equipment and Manet Mesh Data Radio.
