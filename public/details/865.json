We share a unified vision to educate and spread awareness about a healthy\n</p><p>lifestyle- and eating right is a major part of achieving the same.\n</p><p>The process of making organic and natural coconut sugar is a lengthy, tiring and\n</p><p>labour-intensive job. We noticed that these farmers put their heart and soul in making this\n</p><p>beautiful sugar, but their network is very very limited. Our endeavour, as a team, is to help them\n</p><p>widen their reach through the country, because they deserve to make their produce a part of\n</p><p>every kitchen in India.\n</p><p>When we visited Tamil Nadu in search of Raw Banana Flour, we came across a farm owned by\n</p><p>a farmer family of 12 members. We saw their process and realised that these people worked\n</p><p>round the clock to produce excellent quality of banana flour and at the same time, they ensured\n</p><p>that the quality was kept consistent throughout. Having looked at this passion and dedication,\n</p><p>we decided to join hands with them and work together and Kokos Natural was born.\n</p><p>We’re into retailing and wholesaling 100% organic products such as Himalayan Pink Salt, Raw\n</p><p>banana flour, Organic Coconut Sugar, Cassava Flour, Beetroot Powder &amp; Supergreen Powder.
