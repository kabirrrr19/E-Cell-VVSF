[{"email":"devansh76@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Many start-ups are now coming out with apps to provide people with work, order taxis, home delivery, etc. However, new users to the internet find it difficult to navigate so many apps and mostly only use WhatsApp.</p><p><br></p><p>We will integrate with WhatsApp Business API to provide these same services over WhatsApp. We believe the web is evolving, and the future of Web 3.0 will focus on APIs and integrating with apps and platforms that already exist in the marketplace. Such a shift has already occurred in China, where businesses prefer to integrate with WeChatâ€™s API rather than build their own app. We are trying to bring a similar shift in India.</p><p><br></p><p>Our larger idea is, why build an app when you can use WhatsApp? Some of the services provided by apps in the marketplace can easily be conducted over WhatsApp, and the API provides a scalable way of doing so.  Users are already familiar with interface of WhatsApp so it is better for them than learning how to use a new app.</p><p><br></p><p>We have raised money from clients in the non-profit and impact sector that wish to integrate WhatsApp API in their outreach to communities. We are currently working with 3 clients and have raised enough money for at least the next 1 year. Our hope is to gain enough experience and develop enough code by working with these clients that we can launch our own chatbot on WhatsApp that can provide a variety of services to people.</p>","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"VOICEDECK TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Application Development"]},{"email":"khushimehta@learnero.co","idea":"<p>Learnero is the YouTube x Zoom x Coursera for the ed-tech.
