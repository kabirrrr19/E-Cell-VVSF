Value for individuals is generated through a rating consensus among eligible participants thereby allowing each participant to convert their contributions into personal assets. These assets provide valuable insights to the overall knowledge base of the individual. Creation of these proofs or showcases of skill, is not limited by format and individuals can choose freely how best to portray their learnings. With the proliferation of social networks online, the ability to measure socio-economic consensus for various applications has led to great interest in the field of dynamic average consensus over a network. Research from the fields economics, game development, and psychology have been incorporated in the creation of this proposed network.</p><p><br></p><p>Docet’s network has a hierarchal structure which limits participant’s ability to affect change within the network based on their standings in it, vis a vis, a higher-level participant can effect greater change to the standings of others than a lower level participant.&nbsp;</p><p>The hierarchal network as described has weights for each node, the value of which decreases from the topmost level group downwards. For any given node in a group, consensus among each group above it in the network is calculated asynchronously, based on which the next state of the node is determined. The eligibility of affecting the state of the given node is determined by qualifying states possessed by the affecting nodes. Once eligible, state changes suggested for the given node is logged and processed sequentially based on log time at set intervals to calculate consensus of the affecting nodes and the state of the affected node is updated. The following are examples of a few conditions included in the determination of state of the affecting node (noted below as raters):</p><p><br></p><p>♣\tif a participant’s level is changed because of a new pok upload, previous ratings given at that level by said users does not change unless the level change is less than -4. If less than -4, flagged for manual verification to check validity of initial rating given to others. Removal of rating will result in an adjustment for all who have received a rating.</p><p>♣\tif level of the rater changes because of new consensus for him through an increase in the no. of his peers and superiors, then the ratings given by him to everyone else is also adjusted.&nbsp;</p><p>♣\tIt will also affect the bonus perks (explained in detail under Internal Economy) that he has received and can be increased/decreased up to a certain time. Bonuses aren’t convertible for a period of 1 week.&nbsp;</p><p>♣\tBonus perks received will be a function of the rate of change of level score by an individual. Spent rating perk is immediately returned in case of accuracy but bonuses are distributed at each new level through upload.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why Docet is interesting is that it replicates the need for a higher authority to verify/validate a participant’s learning while simultaneously replacing the dependency on a singular authority for it. By doing so, Docet successfully democratizes the generation of value for individual learning and frees them from any restriction on how they acquire their skills. Human ability is the single most valuable commodity in the world. Today, the internet is used as a tool for organisations to identify efficient ways to target individual spending capacity through advertisements instead of evaluating individual knowledge as a commodity in and of itself. The conversion of individual proofs of knowledge as a consolidated validated asset of all the knowledge and skills one possesses can be used as a personal brand allowing participants to position themselves uniquely for qualifying jobs.<br><br></p>","industries":["Education"],"name":"CONSORTIUM OF CORPORATE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Skill Development"]},{"email":"dhwani@luciddreamstudio.com","idea":"We are a cinematic virtual reality experience design and production studio.","industries":["AR VR (Augmented + Virtual Reality)"],"name":"LUCID DREAM STUDIO","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"info@rapidqube.com","idea":"<p>RapidQube is a next generation, disruptive technology solutions provider helping organizations across industries in adapting to the digital shift and enabling them to better engage with customers through robust use of analytics and rapidly innovating product development with swift time-to-market thereby optimizing their total cost of ownership.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rapidqube.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.rapidqube.com/</a></p>","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"RapidQube Digital solutions Pvt Ltd","sectors":["IT Consulting"]}]
