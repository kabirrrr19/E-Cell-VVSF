It hopes to achieve this goal by engineering a 'credibility management tool', the Karma Engine. At the heat of the Karma Engine is an algorithm that can capture, and track, a piece of advice and score it for how well it performed. A series of such pieces of advice from a single source or advisor are then strung together to create a reliability score that can help customers judge what is most trustworthy based on previous performance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like a search engine finds relevant Web pages, the Karma Engine can find a stock advice that is the most likely to perform the best in context of what the retail investor’s goals are. To do this, the Karma Engine will be expressed as a service across internet touchpoints such as the web, web apps, device apps, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is no dearth of advice or information in the market. There is a dearth of credibility. The Karma Engine addresses this fundamental problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take all the equity market services available to the retail investor. Plot them on an inner peace versus control graph and you will find that Stocks &amp; Karma manages to garner a unique spot. It is high on both, peace and control.
