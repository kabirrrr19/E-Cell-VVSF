A country as diverse as India is symbolized for its plurality in art and culture that represents a view of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices.One of these being the Indian arts and handicrafts with its ethnic industry enabling a variety of motifs and craft to flourish on this land.\n<div>\n</div><div>India's industrialization and participation in the modern world economy are decades old. Nevertheless, still millions of Indians depend on indigenous modes of production to make a living based on handicraft products. These, known as craftsmen or artisans are the backbone of the non-farming rural economy. They are common people with many of them living in rural areas and below the poverty line. Most of them take loans from money lenders for the interest of 5% for a month. \n</div><div>\n</div><div>Despite if the circumstances, the majority of the handicraft production remains unorganized and informal with full market potential untapped. Propelled by loss of markets, declining skills and difficulty in catering to New markets a large number of artisans fail to depict their culture leading to unskilled employment in the industry. Here the biggest challenge is to keep their skill relevant and alive.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>With online marketing being the single most booming way of product purchase and making the most opportunities in the field of product promotion, We, Prakriti Handicrafts(OPC) Private Limited, have been a channel for global distribution of handicraft products carved by tribal artisans. The root cause of our company is bringing the tribally created handicraft product into the global limelight through exporting and selling online. The activities dedicated by us include maintaining a favourable environment for the long term development of small scale artisans. We follow a well formed and resplendent manoeuvre. Our chief step is journeying through different states and dropping in by a few innate artisans. The purpose behind this is to draw acquaintance with the various craftsmen across India and to develop an understanding of their skills and craftsmanship apart from purchasing their products. Next in order we have a photo op of the purchased stock in accordance to procreating and representing them spherically. Back to back, with much hardwork and dedication put in by us, it involves wrapping and labelling of the items appropriately and in an international standard form. Thereafter we introduce these items on-screen through online marketing. Our company has a fair merchandising network with USA,UK and other countries globally. Asides marketing with countries, we also have a hook-up with a few e-commerce portals. We also ensure that we send the right quality goods to our clients.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>However, our supreme motto is constructing an interconnection between handicraftsmen, their creativity and the world over. Opening a universal market discursively for our nation's outrageous artisans is our (Prakriti Handicrafts (OPC) Private Limited), Principal mission.</div>","industries":["Retail"],"name":"PRAKRITI HANDICRAFTS (OPC) PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Retail Technology"]},{"email":"maitreya.risbood@gmail.com","idea":"We provide hygenic tea delivery in offices as well as on nakas and nukkads&nbsp;","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"Teaman","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"jikku@taaraka.com","idea":"Taaraka is the vision of building a world-class team that translates the belief and ancient wisdom ensconced in the science of the stars to a handy set of functional tools that can guide everyone to navigate their daily lives, amidst ever-growing complexity!
