Not just that, this policy can be continued to be held by the employees even post-employment thus eliminating the need of buying an independent personal cover. This model solves the problem of duplication that currently exists between corporate and personal health insurance and also acts as a smart growth hack for insurers to tap into lifelong renewal clients by capturing the universe of employees through group health insurance.\n</p><p>In Phase 2, once we have the captive user base of employees, we will expand the platform to cover concierge services (hospital selection advisory, second medical opinion, claim management etc.) to building a self-care app (health check-ups, monitoring daily vitals, personalized health management programs, eye/dental collaborations, tele consultations etc.). We will also provide other forms of insurances such as travel insurance, accident insurance and life insurance on-demand basis to the employees.\n</p><p>--\n</p><p>HealthySure\n</p><p>Reimagining Employee Benefits\n</p><p>www.healthysure.in</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","industries":["Finance Technology"],"name":"SAFETYNET INVESTMENT HOLDINGS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Insurance"]}]
