If harvesting is not done on time, the farmer incurs heavy losses. This forces the farmer to opt for mechanization of harvesting. The present day harvesters available are not suitable for Indian conditions as they cut the cane into small pieces, which forces the farmer and sugar mill to take for crushing on emergency basis, otherwise there would be evaporation losses. Apart from this, the farmer also loses the cane tops that could be used as cattle feed â€“ present day harvesters cut the tops into small pieces.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Solution:\n</p><p>Our idea of developing the whole stalk harvester solves both the above problems, in addition it is more economical due to lesser fuel consumption.\n</p><p>The prototype has been made, and field trials have been taken.</p>","industries":["Agriculture"],"name":"SUPER CANE HARVESTER MACHINES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Agri-Tech"]},{"email":"rachanakher@gmail.com","idea":"NIRBHAYA CABS PRIVATE LIMITED","industries":["Social Impact"],"name":"NIRBHAYA CABS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["NGO"]}]
