Our proprietary indoor positioning technology platform, inLocate, locates people and assets simply through a smartphone in indoor premises like factories, retail stores, offices. GPS tracking technology doesn't work in indoor spaces where people spend more than 90% of their time. Unlike traditional RFID or BLE Beacon tracking technology, inLocate doesn't involve installation or maintenance of any hardware and simply tracks using the smartphone device. inLocate is thus disrupting a 20 year old standard with a more cost-effective and scalable technology. inLocate enables any smartphone to be tracked simply through an app by leveraging the inherent ambient electromagnetic and radio fields of the indoor space thereby being cheaper, faster to implement and thus more scalable. We've filed 3 patents for our technology. \nClean Slate will develop innovative integrated solutions for multiple sectors by leveraging inLocate technology like Manufacturing, Security Patrolling and Retail. \nOur first industry 4.0 solution inLog brings productivity gains and reduces organizational losses for manufacturing and warehousing facilities. By tracking assets on the premises through inLocate and digitizing workflows in the supply chain, inLog brings real time visibility in material flow on the shop-floor to minimize process inefficiencies in the system. Enterprises like Bosch have implemented inLog to digitalize their supply chain process. Data driven analytical insights has helped Bosch realize over 30% productivity gains in just 3 months. No hardware allows inLog to be scaled with half the time of a traditional RFID or Beacon based solution.","industries":["Enterprise Software"],"name":"CLEAN SLATE TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Location Based"]},{"email":"zulfi@poorti.net","idea":"POORTI Platform will provide employment opportunities across the country to various unorganized farmers and unemployed youth to become farm friends and reach out to various farmers to register and solve their grievances.

With our method, we increase the reach of such highly needed services, and also can offer better results in improving behaviours of such children because we undertake intervention strategies in an environment which they spend a lot of time in, ie home or school. Intervention strategies at clinics are not as effective because the environment is not familiar to the child and is very specific.\nWe provide employment to various students with Masters in Psychology, as these candidates have a tough time in the job market. The options open to them are very limited and are restricted to counsellors in clinics and school counsellors. However, because we provide one to one counselling to each child, our employment is much more than clinics in which each counsellor caters to 20 children or more.\nWe are also a heavily women centric organization with 90% of our employees being women, as they are much better at working with special children.","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"STARLIT ABILITY ENHANCEMENT SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Health & Wellness"]},{"email":"maxson.lewis@magentapower.in","idea":"<p>Magenta Power is in the business of Clean Energy based EV Charging Solutions under the ChargeGrid brand.
