I would love to introduce my brand The Kaatn Trail to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The Kaatn Trail is symbolic to tremendous love and passion for what we curate here. At TKT, we create simple and minimalistic yet smart and classy, all day wear designs that are made from natural fibers, hand-woven, khadi fabrics sourced from various skilled artisans across India. We truly love collaborating contemporary silhouettes with traditional hand-woven Indian textiles. We call them timeless beauties. Most of our fabrics are herbal dyed, which means dyes are made out of herbs, fruits, plants and flowers.\n</p><p>Our prime focus is to craft patterns that are skillfully simple, elegant and can be worn from a weekday to weekend! It leaves us in immense pride that we bring our heritage fabrics into play! On this journey, we aim to revisit the forgotten path of our heirloom and also carve new trail for our beloved textiles. Hence we decided to aptly name it as The Kaatn Trail. The word Kaatn is derived from “Cotton” and rightly spelled as K-aa-t-n.\n</p><p>&nbsp;After spending years in corporate world we realized, that’s one place (workplace) where khadi has not seeped–in yet. With a four-fold increase in working women population, we felt it was need of the hour to introduce khadi in a refreshingly contemporary look making it a complete package from being classy to comfortable.\n</p><p>With the growing awareness for eco-friendly clothing and sustainable fashion, it’s highly imperative that we take conscious efforts and ensure rightful production of garments. Our fabrics are tested for dye and also we have personally visited our weaving units to ascertain the genuineness of the fabrics used by us. \n</p><p>Although it all began with khadi, however, we also have pure handloom fabrics serving the purpose for us!\n</p><p>We always wanted to give back to the society in whatever small way we could. With this objective in our heart, we reached out to a NGO and they helped us to connect with the set of  skilled women from less privileged society. These determined women help us with creative ideas to up-cycle our fabric scraps by making scrunchies, potli bags etc. We are already working with them for making accessories like neckpieces and finger rings from the scraps. More work means more income for them and that gives us a sense of fulfillment. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>You can visit us on - \n</p><p>\n</p><p>Website - www.thekaatntrail.com\n</p><p>Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/thekaatntrail\n</p><p>Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/tkt2019/</p>","industries":["Fashion"],"name":"The Kaatn Trail","sectors":["Apparel"]},{"email":"info@oleafherbal.com","idea":"<p><span>Oleaf began with its own olive plantations in Rajasthan and collaborated with local farmers, generating employment to rural women in Bikaner, Rajasthan, and mastering the art of cultivating olives.
