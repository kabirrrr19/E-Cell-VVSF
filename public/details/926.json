The main motto behind this was \"No child should sleep on an empty stomach\". Being responsible citizens of India and the world, it is our duty to make sure that every human being sleeps with a full stomach. The app is user-friendly! There are two major sections in the app named - \"Give\" and \"Take\". If you want to give away the food to the needy, you need to just click on the \"Give\" option followed by capturing an image of the food item, details and finally posting the food item to our app. Anyone who is in need of food or is hungry can go to the \"Take\" section and receive any food item by clicking on any one of the options from \"Call\" or \"Share\". The \"Call\" option will directly make a call to the user who has uploaded the food item whereas the \"Share\" option will provide you the facility to share the respective post among your friends or anybody of your contacts by making use of any one of the social media options. In case, if the user doesn't want to share his personal information, we can therefore directly go on the \"Call\" button provided in the Home screen and can Give his food by having a one-to-one call with anyone of our Team members. There is a \"Selfie Point\" option in the app where regular images will be uploaded of food items successfully being delivered to the needy so as to maintain a clear mirror of satisfaction between the users and the app thus, strengthening the trust between the users and the Nivala. Users don't need to have the app installed in their smartphones in order to receive the respective food item that was shared to them by their friends from the app since all the details of the respective food will be provided to them as a message when their friends share them the post of the respective food. Users do need to mandatorily signup into the app and login into the app in order to start using the app so as to provide security and safety to its users. Also, the food item posted along with the details would be successfully removed from the app once it has been delivered to the needy. Once the food item posted reaches it's expiry date and time, it would be automatically removed from the database so as to avoid food poisoning to the users who consume food through the app. The expiry date is provided in two categories - Date and Time format. Users can enter address or phone number or both as per their preference<br>","industries":["Social Impact"],"name":"Nivala","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"insecsys@insecsys.com","idea":"Our History<div>INSECSYS, founded in 2008, incorporated in 2016.</div><div><br></div><div>InSecSys, founded in 2008, incorporated in 2016 is having a vision to pioneer in the field Information Security Consulting, training, providing professional expertise in designing a developing Security Infrastructure for Corporate network.
