The objective, to work on the Agri. input distribution and make a wide portfolio of products available to the farmers at the right price point.  During the first phase, the organization bought products from Ag Manufacturers, stocked in the warehouses to distribute it to Ag-dealers registered with the company. In 2013, the organization launched its own products and started selling those through the existing distribution network. \n<div>\n</div><div>Early in 2015, we realized the limitations of the current model. the impact that was to be made in the Indian Agriculture sector was still far away. Technology, as the experts said was the future and we agreed. So, in June 2015, we launched a B2B E-commerce portal for Agri- inputs, connecting the Ag Manufactures with the Dealers in Maharashtra (- DestaMart); So as to also be relevant to the Farmers, an Agri. info portal “DestaTalk” was launched to bring awareness about the ever-growing Agriculture -products &amp; new technology among farmers in May 2015.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>The next two years Desta team worked on building a good network of farmers (2.5 Lakhs), Ag- manufacturers (130+) &amp; Ag-dealers (6000+) using online and offline mediums to provide Agri-inputs at the right time and right price.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>In the later part of 2017 we built a robust CRM system to capture the Market data and to bring in excellence in the consumer facing functions, Sales – BD and Call Centre teams.
