The past decade has seen the emergence of donation crowdfunding&nbsp;</span><span>platforms, but those have focussed on aggregating fund seekers and promoted their&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>causes by inviting donors using digital marketing. This has limited effectiveness. As&nbsp;</span><span>a result, the sum total of the donations collected by all such platforms over the past&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>decade only runs into a few hundred crores. This number is too small for a country&nbsp;</span></p><p>with the population and GDP of India. The absence of charity makes all social\n&nbsp;<span>causes dependent on the government.
