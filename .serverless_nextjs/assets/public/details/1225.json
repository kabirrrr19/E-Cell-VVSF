[{"email":"sandy@escabrahma.com","idea":"Esca Brahma started with a vision to popularise Indian coastal cuisine and put it on the world map. It will incubate many concepts from fine dine to casual dine to QSR; targeting all the segments to proliferate the flavours from the coast.\n\n \n\nEvery concept is carefully crafted and positioned based on process innovation, strategic positioning of the concept in a crowded market place, use of technology and least dependency on the creative expertise of a chef. For example Curry Tales is positioned between restaurants and home (home style, curated from homes) and also run by line cooks based on QSR processes. Affordable fine dine is based on chefs who are operationally good and priced affordably, and flavours and approach are defined by Esca Brahma. QSR is based on technology which will take away the dependency of the person who can make the base product. All the concepts are designed to scale from initial design, can easily be ported abroad all the processes are standardised to ensure the flavours and quality are centrally controlled by streamlining the supply chain.\n\n \n\nAll the concepts, which are going to be implemented in the next 8-12 months will be under the main umbrella of Esca Brahma Gourmet Pvt Ltd, which will raise investments both in to the holding company as well as the subsidiaries. The vision is to grow to Rs. 25 crore complete gourmet Company by 2020. Year 2 will see retail products and Esca Brahma working as an incubator for other regional cuisines.","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"ESCABRAHMA GOURMET PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Restaurants"]},{"email":"naveen@eaudition.in","idea":"eAUDITION, first of its kind, is an independent platform, helping anyone audition from anywhere!
