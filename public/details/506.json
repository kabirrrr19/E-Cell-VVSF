A Diabetic Chef is here to bury that phrase forever. What started off as a blog with recipes for diabetics and weight-watchers, turned into a full-fledged cloud kitchen serving Mumbai a range of sugar-free brownies and other treats. Founded by our Chef, Harsh Kedia, a 23-year-old entrepreneur who has been living with diabetes since teenage, took it upon himself to promote healthy eating. After diving into some thorough research and product development for some time, we‚Äôre reopening to cure all your woes!</p><p><br></p><p>When we started out, we had the intent of creating something of genuine value to the diabetic and health-conscious community. And we still stand on those grounds today.

But do we even really know anymore what we‚Äôre having?</p><p><br></p><p>A Diabetic Chef is here to change the way chocolate works. While using the good ol‚Äô skills of a chocolatier, the innovation is in the ingredients that we use. According to the unbreakable chocolatier code #101, the richness of the cocoa beans must be uncompromised. We use some of the finest West African cocoa beans to not only to stick to that code, but also to see you go ‚Äúmmmm‚Äù when you take that first bite. The cocoa beans are paired with the well-rounded flavour of bourbon vanilla. And much to your delight, we use zero-carb and zero-calorie stevia.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Chocolate&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Chocolate is one of the most misunderstood foods there is.

Entire world is desperately trying to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius. Fossil fuels have been primarily responsible for increased CO2 concentration in environment and efforts are being made to decarbonize the energy value chain. Large clean energy deployment programs are being put in place by almost all countries in the world.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>While traditionally these programs favor large grid scale installations, small scale renewable energy technologies are becoming increasingly viable. Rooftop solar, waster to energy, small wind, small gas turbines installations are seen frequently. At the same time, energy management technologies such as demand side management, demand response, remote monitoring aided by Internet of Things and Operational Technologies (IoT/OT) are evolving very fast and delivering decentralized solutions to consumers and utilities alike.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Two other important trends can not be ignored. These are electrification of usage and emergence of battery storage technologies. Electrification of mobility in the form electric vehicles and green hydrogen fueled vehicles is reaching commercial viability. Similarly, electrification of cooking in the form of induction cooking and other appliances is gaining significant traction in urban areas. At the same time, battery costs have dropped by nearly 90% over last decade. As a result, it is neither necessary to consume electricity when generated nor required to transmit over long distances.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>These changes are going to have profound impact on the distribution grid and 'Future Distribution Grid' is going to be significantly different from the existing one. It is necessary to develop new technologies, solutions and business models which would enable the future distribution grid integrate small renewable energy resources, energy management technologies and battery storage technologies while enabling electrification of newer and newer applications across consumer segments.
