[{"email":"siddharth@gatewayvr.io","idea":"GatewayVR is a data-focused virtual reality (VR) start-up creating enterprise solutions for the phygital world, and we look to spearhead the digital transformation of the physical world through the innovative use of immersive technologies like Virtual and Augmented Reality.\n<div>\n</div><div>As far as our offerings are concerned, we have two core products - both of which are targeted towards the Real Estate and Retail space. Through the development of both these products, we have made a concerted effort to reduce the barrier to entry for large brands and corporations to use VR/AR as a business tool.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>EmporioVR\n</div><div>\n</div><div>A solution that allows Brands to create and maintain VR stores, allowing shoppers to seamlessly shop in VR. Our backend interface allows brands to create their stores in VR without the need of an army of developers and game programmers, reducing the store development and set-up to a drag and drop experience through a Web/VR experience. EmporioVR also seamlessly integrates with other Inventory Management Software and ERP Systems, thereby negating the need of having multiple dashboards to track inventory. The EmporioVR platform works well for brands and retailers in the Home Improvement, Luxury Apparel and the High Street Fashion space. \n</div><div>Also, in the pipeline for EmporioVR is an Augmented Reality solution.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Design Room - Interior Visualisation \n</div><div>\n</div><div>This is targeted toward Real Estate and the Home Improvement Retail space. \n</div><div>The Interior Visualisation platform is a Web + VR solution. On the web, the user is able to draw out their house/room. One this information is entered into the system; a 3D model of the room/house is created on the web. At this point, the user can select the furniture that he/she wants to place inside their room. The user can also customise their space with wall furnishings, flooring, tiles, windows, doors and other pieces of artwork. Once this is done, the user is able to launch this in VR and experience the products and space. \n</div><div>\n</div><div>In the Real Estate space, this platform allows users to customise their own homes with their preferences. By customising their homes and then viewing them in VR, the user has a higher emotional engagement with the actual living space and is able to visualise it as their own. This dramatically increases spontaneous recall in the minds of a user and could ultimately tilt the final decision in the favour of the space with which the user had the maximum emotional engagement. With this solution, we also open the possibilities of brand partnerships and integrations. Real Estate clients can partner with our brands in the Home Improvement space and allow their products to be showcased as a part of their offering - with this, the final offering to the end customer is the not only just the ‘house’, but a fully furnished done up ‘home’.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>In the Retail Space, this platform allows users in retail environments to draw out their room/house and then place the products they are about to buy in the store. The idea is for the user to get a comprehensive understanding of the space constraints and how they may look together in their homes. The underlying reason for this product in the market is for the customer to be able to make a better-informed purchase decision. The retailers in the home improvement sector lose money because of the high operational costs of returns on products. \n</div><div>\n</div><div>Future Development Pipeline\n</div><div>\n</div><div>In our pipeline, we are also considering a foray into the Buyer Behaviour space that will allow us to work with research firms to better their focus group and market tests, through unbiased use of data that we will track in Virtual Reality via Eye Tracking, Brain Wave Mapping, Heart Rate Monitoring and Body Temperature Tracking. Through this, we aim to help provide tangible, unambiguous data solutions to clients. This would also integrate seamlessly into both our offerings and help us provide valuable insights into Real Estate and the Retail industry - both in brick and mortar retail and VR.</div>","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"GATEWAYVR PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["IT Consulting"]},{"email":"prashant.kumar@eigenlytics.com","idea":"<a href=\"http://www.eigenlytics.com\" target=\"_blank\">Company's Website</a><br>","industries":["Analytics"],"name":"EIGENLYTICS DATA SOLUTIONS LLP","sectors":["Data Science"]},{"email":"viveksangeet@gmail.com","idea":"Here at Boxbourne technologies, we expect to be the one-stop-look for all the vaping needs with the greatest and the absolute best choice in vaping equipment and extras.Our main motto lies in the fact the the smokers have an option to shift to a healthier alternative.
