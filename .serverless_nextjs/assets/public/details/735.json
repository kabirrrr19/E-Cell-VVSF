Ltd. Company is a service provider to the Motor Training School Businesses at a cost-effective price, that includes backend processing of all types of the application submitted in the RTO, physical support for processing in the RTO, Data collection, management, and optimization, a call center for customer needs, all of this through a Mobile App. The same mobile app available on the customer’s side also provides an m-market place for the Training School businesses to list their training slots for booking by the customers through the app. Along with it, this app provides additional options to the customers such as to book a certified trained Driver in different categories on an hourly, daily, or monthly basis, and another option to avail car rental services whereby the vehicles will predominantly run by a renewable source of energy. The company partners with the Motor Training School businesses (help diversify its business model) to buy an (electric) car for rental services and to provide booking services of the Drivers. The government reforms in the transport industry place a premium on incorporating advancements that permit the driver’s training service providers to operate as optimally as possible. The Motor Driving and Compliance Industry in India are typically dominated by the presence of a large number of small and micro-businesses that operate in an informal, unorganized manner. Many of these are single person micro-businesses that cannot afford to buy and maintain their own infrastructure. The company introduces a Hub and Spoke model where the idea is to arrange the service delivery assets of driver’s training, driving license, and vehicle-related services into a network anchored by the Company – LearnDrive Online Solutions Pvt. Ltd (Hub) offers a full array of services, complemented by secondary establishments i.e. the Motor Training Schools and agents (Spoke) which offer more limited service arrays, routing customers needing all drivers and vehicle-related services at a click of a button on the mobile app of the company. This business model helps in 1. Creation of an organized market for driving and vehicle compliance industry. 2. Uncovers revenue opportunities at all stages of growth and expansion. 3. Improvement of the overall work environment through cashless and paperless systems. 4. Ensures adherence to government norms and reduces end-user overheads.</p>","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"LEARNDRIVE ONLINE SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Product Development"]},{"email":"kumar.pratik61@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Épi Smart stands for Épicerie Smart or Grocery Smart.\n</p><p>\n<span>Introduced during the COVID-19 Pandemic with an motive of connecting Customers and Stores while maintaining Social Distancing.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\n<span>Helping the Customers to search nearby stores and&nbsp;</span></p><p>conveniently order groceries from home.\n</p><p>\n<span>Helping the Stores to maintain social distancing by&nbsp;</span></p><p>reducing the queues.</p>","industries":["Retail"],"name":"Ãpi Smart","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"ranjan@palankarta.com","idea":"<p>The one stop solution for all the accounting, taxation, financial advisory and ancillary needs for all the business irrespective of the size and Nature of business.
