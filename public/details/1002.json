This cost effective, low environmental impact project looks at an adaptive\n</div><div>reuse of old shipping containers. With universal sizes of 20 and 40 feet, these containers albeit their rigid outlook, have\n</div><div>the potential to radically transform into creative architectural expressions. Made to withstand extreme ocean weather\n</div><div>and to carry tons of cargo across the world, the robustness of containers provides a secure habitable framework.\n</div><div><br></div><div>The design intent for “Airbox” is to fundamentally change the perception of public infrastructure which is primitive and\n</div><div>awfully pragmatic. Design tools such as “slice”, “lift” and “tilt” helped convert the appearance of a brutally ordered box into\n</div><div>an inspiring urban object. Stench and suffocation inherently keep people away from using public toilets. By slicing and\n</div><div>elevating a 20 feet shipping container, Airbox has created a natural passage of air from underneath that flows out from\n</div><div>above the toilet cubicles. This tilt creates an expanded space internally adding a sense of “lightness” and generating twice\n</div><div>the amount of airflow without using a single exhaust fan. Thus – Airbox.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Knowing that a rural landscape hugely differs from that of an urban one, Airbox has ensured that the interiors are\n</div><div>customisable both in terms of facilities and costs to meet requirements of the landscape these toilets are deployed in.\n</div><div>With its versatile nature, Airbox can be deployed on highways, railway platforms, public spaces and schools catering to\n</div><div>the urban workforce.</div>","industries":["Social Impact"],"name":"AIRBOX TOILETS","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"anil@lmskit.com","idea":"LMSKIT is a Learning Management System which helps organization to train their employees to increase their efficiency and productivity.\n<div>Our LMS platform helps organizations identify employee training needs through assessments.
