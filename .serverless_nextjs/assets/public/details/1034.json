Unfortunately, it remains another&nbsp;never-started new year resolution.&nbsp;Simply because it's too much effort - finding a good guitar teacher, managing class schedule, traveling to classes and that too on the weekend. Moreover, it takes around 3 months before you can start your first song.</p><p>Existing Solution -&nbsp;</p><p>The current methodology of teaching guitar is very slow and boring. For the first 3 months, there is no-output to be seen for the learner. The feeling of playing songs starts only after that. This test the patience and 70% of people leave learning guitar before reaching this point.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Online courses have tried to solve this problem but all they have done is, delivered the same teachings in a digital medium. This way, although convenient for many users as they can follow it at-home, is still the same in term of teaching methodology. They still don’t develop the motivation to keep on going.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Our Solution -&nbsp;</p><p>With Guitar Bro, we have to change the method of learning completely using 3 components.&nbsp;</p><p>1. Video Lectures for an explanation</p><p>2. Instruction book with 30+ songs.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Our Patent pending hardware tool for learning. + 31-day work plan</p><p>These components work similar to how “training wheels” works for a bicycle.
