Celebrities, such as entertainment personalities, sportsmen and the like, travel through the airplanes carrying other air-travelers. The other air-travelers may be interested in availing an opportunity to sit near the celebrities. Sitting with the celebrities may provide air travelers with an opportunity to spend invaluable time interacting with the celebrities, exchanging views, seeking opinions, and learning from their experience. Few air-travelers may further be interested in availing an opportunity to sit next to the celebrities even by paying a premium amount for their air tickets. However, any information about the celebrities traveling on an airplane is generally unavailable to the air-travelers, and therefore, the air-travelers may remain devoid of an opportunity of selecting a particular celebrity next to whom he/she may wish to be seated.
