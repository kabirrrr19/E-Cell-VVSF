We undertake Liasioning, consultancy and outsourcing contracts for Real Estate Developers, Contractors, Sub-Contractors, Government authorities, etc. we also deal in scrap material consisting of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, papers, plastic, etc. We have our warehouse established in the Uttar-shiv area near Kalyan Shilphata to ensure the swift movement of materials from the outskirts of the city. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>We have Mr. Ashish Jaswantrai Mehta at the helm to oversee and control the Liasioning, Consultancy as well as Metal scrap business. Mr. Mehta comes with an experience of more than two decades in varied fields including Automotive Sector, Real Estate, and Metal Recycling. Projects worth more than 100 Crores in value are effectively handled and completed by him from the perspective of Government / Statutory approvals. Business contracts come-in seamlessly with his level of contacts and connections with Government Decision Makers and Influencers and Administrators.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The Metal scrap trading business is very well established for the past couple of years (under a different company and brand) and presently the same is also consolidated under this entity. The Metal scrap industry is mainly controlled through the informal sector which has minimal contributions to the economy as well as the industry. We, on the other hand, are a team of professionals, operating in the industry through a structured and law adhering framework. Sourcing of our materials is done through various corporates, government agencies, local markets – mainly formal. We have our network of business associates at Pan India level and are capable of material pick up throughout the entire territorial boundaries of India. With the growing scarcity of natural resources and growing awareness about correct methods of disposal and environment-friendly options of re-using the old waste, channeling the end-of-life scrap materials to correct recyclers is surely a big business opportunity in the current decade. We are proud to be part of the wave right from the very beginning.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>We look forward to an opportunity to be part of your esteemed organization in the near future.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Thank you!</p>","industries":["Professional & Commercial Services"],"name":"LEO INFRA DEVELOPMENT PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Business Support Services"]},{"email":"snl.pote@gmail.com","idea":"<p>In the ongoing period, Designing is playing an important Role to Company, Brand, Organization, For promoting their Business or Brand in Various Media like newspapers, magazines, advertising campaigns, films, television programs, mobiles, books and online media.
