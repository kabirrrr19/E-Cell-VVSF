The RUDRI model is something that saves them loads of money. While collaborating with RUDRI to showcase their range of products at our stores the Designer Labels &amp; Brands are only required to invest into stocks whereas store rents, electricity bills, salesmanâ€™s cost etc. are borne by us. This is not only benefit, certain multi designer store charge Monthly Charges &amp; need sales commitments whereas RUDRI is free from all except Margins on Sale, which means the brands/designers are bound to pay us only if we are able to sell their goods at their MRP. This not only saves enormous working capital costs but as consumers it also brings costs down by 35-40% at least.","industries":["Fashion"],"name":"Vibhutee Designer Ensembles Private Limited","sectors":["Apparel"]},{"email":"sales@valgineering.com","idea":"We are Engineering and Consulting firm having an expertise in Terminal Automation for Oil &amp; Gas and Petrochemical Industry.
