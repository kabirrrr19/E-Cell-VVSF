The general idea of this app, as it differed from other music streaming apps, is that here each user of the app has to pay a minimum monthly subscription fee to the app and can subscribe to 5 artists in return. The listener/user can subscribe to more artists by paying more fees. This subscription fee, after payment gateway and maintenance charges will be directly deposited in the artists' bank account. Any user who has subscribed to minimum 5 artist can become an Artist on this platform and upload his/her songs, by filling a simple form. While uploading he/she has to pay an upload fee. This application will not contain any kind of advertisement and will not be containing any bollywood songs which are released on other platforms. It is an open platform which can be used by anyone. All the music in this app would be independent of bollywood, Hollywood or any such music copyrighted by any other music label or company. This app also won't consist any cover songs. An artist can upload any number of songs, that he or she has himself or herself composed or produced.
