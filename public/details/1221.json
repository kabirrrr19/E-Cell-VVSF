[{"email":"htenggco@gmail.com","idea":"Steel drum and barrel Industry is ancillary to oil, chemical, pharmaceutical and food industry in any country. It produces round steel drum mainly in standard 200Liters,160Kg and 20 liters. \nWith engineering back ground and over 50 years working in steel drum industry I have developed a breakthrough technology to reduce the weight further to half of the present 18kg which is a big step forward in line with the trend world over. Advanced Material Technology help has been taken for laminating two 0.25mm thick sheets with recycled polymer in between in sandwiched construction in the lamination process to manufacture these AMT drums. This will not only reduce the weight but also reduces cost of a drum by 25 to 30%. Therefore it would be an attractive adoption proposition for the ailing drum industry. \nIn Advanced Material Technology the sandwiching construction which has been developed only about 30 years back in USA is gaining popularity in weight sensitive industries like Aerospace, Aviation and Auto industry. Since the sandwich construction reduces the weight without sacrificing the strength criteria of this structure it has helped in increasing the fuel efficiency of their vehicles.Special feature of this technology is that an increase in the thickness of polymer used in the sandwich construction say by a factor 3 will increase the structural strength of the combination by 3X3x3=27 times. \nTo manufacture these newly developed AMT drums additional Special Purpose Machines required which has been designed by us in details.","industries":["Construction"],"name":"HYBRID TECH ENGINEERING CO LLP","sectors":["Construction & Engineering"]},{"email":"akshay@addupmath.com","idea":"Product: Our product is a module-based subscription box that uses an engaging hands-on game, a set of apply-books that focus on practice through real-world themes and flashcards for instant revision and learning reinforcement.
