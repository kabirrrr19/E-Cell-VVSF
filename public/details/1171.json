With disastrous results. Sometimes project risks bring up threats and opportunities that remain to managed, with equally disastrous results. The solution lies in maintaining a fine balance between all. This is where we come in with our Experience and Expertise in project management.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We are Cubic Turnkey Pvt. Ltd., Architects, Valuers, Trainers and Software developers. Our secret of success lies in the team of highly motivated staff, skilled and trained in their domain of project delivery catalysed by an environment for sharing of ideas and innovation. Well equipped office with continuous technology up-gradation supports online updating of data throughout the organisation. With market resources getting scarce, our emphasis is on automation and mechanisation for efficiency and effectiveness.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We develop simple but innovative tools for professionals. Currently, we have completed coding of a tablet-based software that will help evaluate building and carry out structural audits. The tool is one of its first kind in the world. We have collaborated with Professor Emeritus of The University of Texas at Austin, Dr. Richard Klingner, who has defined the flow of the program. It confirms to the ASCE standard as there is no Indian Standard for the process. It enforces a structured methodology during the audit and stores data in a structured manner. It evaluates the Internal, External and Seismic aspects of the building structure. The reports generated by the program essentially are quick and the process is essentially efficient as compared to manual Structural evaluation of buildings. We strive to implement the software on projects where we consult.</span><span></span></p>","industries":["Construction"],"name":"CUBIC TURNKEY PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Construction & Engineering"]},{"email":"info@dhibridge.com","idea":"BATTO TECHNOLOGIES INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED","industries":["Green Technology"],"name":"BATTO TECHNOLOGIES INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Clean Tech"]},{"email":"KS21AUG@GMAIL.COM","idea":"NEUTROFEAST PRIVATE LIMITED","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"NEUTROFEAST PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Health & Wellness"]},{"email":"darshan@imdsexprts.com","idea":"LUMOS CONSULTANCY SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"LUMOS CONSULTANCY SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Product Development"]},{"email":"amitsingh_02@rediffmail.com","idea":"ADM SYSTEMS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED","industries":["Analytics"],"name":"ADM SYSTEMS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Big Data"]},{"email":"sacomopvt@gmail.com","idea":"SACOMO PRIVATE LIMITED","industries":["Technology Hardware"],"name":"SACOMO PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Electronics"]},{"email":"ahatripsindia@gmail.com","idea":"AHA EXPEDITIONS LLP","industries":["Travel & Tourism"],"name":"AHA EXPEDITIONS LLP","sectors":["Experiential Travel"]},{"email":"bharatchandan28@gmail.com","idea":"PREOWNED TRUCKS-N-BUS PRIVATE LIMITED","industries":["Other Specialty Retailers"],"name":"PREOWNED TRUCKS-N-BUS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Auto Vehicles, Parts & Service Retailers"]},{"email":"jc369@outlook.com","idea":"Jatin Chheda","industries":["Green Technology"],"name":"Jatin Chheda","sectors":["Waste Management"]},{"email":"esskay303@gmail.com","idea":"Provide online services and subscription based access to customers","industries":["Professional & Commercial Services"],"name":"Suresh Rathore","sectors":["Professional Information Services"]}]
