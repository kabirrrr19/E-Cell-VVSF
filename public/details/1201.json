With the passing of this resolution, such installations are permissible (including but not limited to backlit panels and fixations atop the carrier). The ease of installation shall be subject to the requirements relating to visibility, safety, distractions and so forth. The Maharashtra State Transport Authority in their document, titled “ITEM NO:9, Regarding advertisement on vehicles falling in Motor Cab Category, in accordance with section 134{1] of Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Rules 1989” categorically lists the size restrictions, possible placements, and other specifications for all advertisement mediums. \n<div>The number of “kaali-peeli” taxis in Mumbai is estimated to be 55,000. As Litcorp, our motive is to be the first mover to take advantage of the newly passed resolution; through advertisement installations fixed atop the carriers of the “kali-peeli” taxis, and maximum visibility that comes from the design. \n</div><div>The carriers on top of the taxis have 3 standardized designs. Therefore, the moment of maximum opportunity is now as no other media firms to the best of our knowledge have started working on installations such as these, and our design specifications are such that they encompass almost all taxi requirements.\n</div><div>Our business model is rudimentary in nature. The nature of the numbers forecast in this document come from thorough research into the costs and notional profits keeping in mind the marketability of the service we are going to offer, as well as the requirements cited by the various authorities pertaining to the matter at hand.\n</div><div>Litcorp shall provide for the installations for the carriers, negotiate with agencies that would possibly utilize our spaces, and for periodic redressing of advertisements even when taxis are not in use.\n</div><div>Advertising on top of taxi cabs is a previously untapped market, which can provide major benefits to the Taxi unions as well as all the taxi owners that come under their jurisdiction.</div>","industries":["Advertising"],"name":"Litcorp","sectors":["AdTech"]},{"email":"satish.harde@bluetieglobal.com","idea":"<p>BRIEF: </p><p>Building individual professional networks requires a lot of time, money and dedication, and so does maintaining these networks.
