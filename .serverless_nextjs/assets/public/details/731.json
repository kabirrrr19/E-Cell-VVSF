Our model is trying to bridge the gap in production deficit in the segment of food grain (oilseeds and pulses) and raw medicinal plant material, which are 2 important cash crop commodities.  \n</p><p>Our model is focused on developing sustainable regional grain and medicinal plant agri-food cluster for the upliftment of the regional rural economy and doubling the farm income. Agri-food clusters can become one of the tools for creating high-performance well-orchestrated production facilities to ensure food supply as well as sustainable development of the agri-food sector.\n</p><p>To make the agri-cluster model successful, Gravitino is instrumental to develop a common platform to connect 3 stakeholders: government, farmers, and agro supply chain members to maintain supply-demand ratio. Gravitino’s role will be an operational partner to run this model smoothly by extending government subsidies, policies &amp; benefits to farmers, to safeguard farmer's income from any unforeseen natural calamities, and to promote farmers to adapt &amp; implement new profit-driven practices. Pan-India scalability of this model can be achieved through different governmental agencies like agricultural universities, rural agricultural nodal centers, and various farmers organizations.      \n</p><p>This model has been discussed and developed by the Ministry of Ayush, Ministry of Agriculture, and MSME ministry.
