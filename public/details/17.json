Each quote will have a clear breakdown of aircrafts and airports and reasons they have been selected for you. Should you wish to go ahead they will then book the aircraft and send you all the flight details including directions to the terminal and any other important information. They will be your first point of call for any further enquiries you may have up to the flight and, if possible, they will meet you at the terminal. From your initial quote you will be able to contact your account manager 24/7 (if on holiday you will be assigned another account manager to cover) so you can call from wherever, whenever you like.\n</p><p>HOW DO I DECIDE WHICH AIRCRAFT TO CHARTER ?\n</p><p>Your dedicated account manager will advise you and provide you with a suitable range of aircraft based on your requirements, assisting you with your final decision. View our aircraft guide for further information.\n</p><p>HOW LONG BEFORE MY FLIGHT I NEED TO CHECK IN ?\n</p><p>Using private terminals means that you are able to check-in much closer to take-off than you could on a scheduled service flight. Sometimes you can arrive as little as 15 minutes before the aircraft is due to depart, and in some cases you can even be driven directly to the aircraft for boarding.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","industries":["Transportation & Storage"],"name":"RAVIDAS AIRLINES LIMITED","sectors":["Passenger Transportation Services"]},{"email":"info@inovec.in","idea":"<p>To use technology solutions by artificial intelligence, machine learning, augmented reality, smart sensors in order to help digitize the long process for product manufacturing at a factory level and convert it into a smart factory.</p>","industries":["Enterprise Software"],"name":"INOVEC SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"numenventures@gmail.com","idea":"<p>We are a printing and packaging company.
