By the upcoming years, the government hopes to have a mandate for ethanol blends in gasoline of at least 20 per cent.

Specially, in the post pandemic world, the need for technology adoption has been felt strongly by all organizations. While large corporates can afford to take services of big IT firms, the same is not true for small and mid-sized companies. Also ,large IT companies usually have standard solutions. Customization is costly and time-consuming. This is causing a digital gap between large and mid sized companies.</p><p> \n</p><p>In this scenario, how can small and mid-sized companies reap the benefit of technology adoption? They have smaller needs, less budget and limited technical know-how. But the need for process automation, data analytics, risk management and other services are there for all organizations.  \n</p><p>Our startup Igniatek aims to solve this problem by democratizing automation and other tech solutions. We bring the apparently complex world of “automation” to the realm of common folks in easy, cost-effective way. It can be adopted by even those small or mid-sized companies which can not afford to have dedicated IT department. The problem areas and solutions are modularized based on industry and function. Hence any client can choose exactly the portion they want to implement. This reduces redundancy and offer better value for money to the clients.</p>","industries":["Enterprise Software"],"name":"IGNIATEK CONSULTANCY PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"applestationery16@gmail.com","idea":"<p>STATIONERY PRINTING TONER CARTRIDGE HOUSEKEEPING MATERIAL CORPORATE SUPPLIER</p>","industries":["Others"],"name":"APPLE STATIONERY AND XEROX","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"ajitcipla@gmail.com","idea":"<p>ULTEUM PHARMA PRIVATE LIMITED is a pharmaceutical company registered under Companies Act, 2013.
