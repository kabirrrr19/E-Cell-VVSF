You finally have your degree in hands and can't wait to go out and start earning for yourself. Everything seems nice, and you expects to land a good job wherever you go for interview.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this myth gets busted when actually start looking for a job.</p><p>Why? - because you are a fresher with no experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Industries are often reluctant to hire fresher's as this means spending additional time and resources on training.&nbsp;</p><p>So there's a catch-22 situation here. Freshers have nowhere to go and don't know whom to approach.</p><p>They are stuck in an infinite loop of- \"without job there will be no experience and without experience there is no job\".&nbsp;</p><p>So, what are we trying to do? - break the loop.</p><p>How?- by providing what's n<span>eeded- \"experience\"</span></p><p>But experience in what?- experience on skills that industry demands for.</p><p>How are we going to do this?- by providing skill training and hands on experience through workshops,&nbsp;</p><p>You choose the skill, we'll handle the rest..</p><p>But whom are we doing this for?- Bioscience undergraduates and fresher's.&nbsp;</p><p>They get to decide, whether they want to join in the 2nd year/3rd year or even after graduation.

You can say that I am an Accidental Entrepreneur.</p><p>After lock-down as you know the unemployment rate has increased. It's hard to find a new job .So I observe that people are interested in Entrepreneurship instead of finding a new job. Whatever experience they have stated coaching, consulting, trading &amp; catering &amp; so on.</p><p>I decided to interview them. after that,  I found out Even though they are experts in their particular niche it's not enough thing to start a new business. They are having problems.</p><p>eg. Mr. Manoj has more than ten years of experience in fitness &amp; bodybuilding. So he decides to convert his passion into a business &amp; start a supplement store online &amp; gym &amp; guiding to locals about exercise which they can do at home &amp; stay healthy.</p><p>It was a good concept but,  he doesn't have an idea about how to apply for a license to sell supplements,  advertising, website building graphics, billing, shipping &amp; so many things.</p><p>In short, if you have an idea it's not like you woke up &amp; start it up.</p><p>So after some interviews, I note down what is the requirement of these people.</p><p>like eg:</p><p>investment Fund</p><p>Place for Business</p><p>Interior</p><p>licensing/Registrations</p><p>marketing</p><p>Website &amp; graphics</p><p>Video &amp; Photos</p><p>Accounting &amp; billing.</p><p><br></p><p>So instead of going ten places, how about the first-time entrepreneur will get all of these services in one place at a pocket-friendly price. Because from start-up to set up is a very crucial time for every entrepreneur. They have handled multiple things &amp; its hard to manage time.</p><p>So my Venture \"Start it up\" is for the First-time entrepreneur Who's having a Business idea &amp; wants to make it real.&nbsp;</p><p>Service Charges depend on the package of services.</p><p><br></p><p>I am Tax analyst as well as a CA article working in a small Ca firm. I am having past 7 years of experience &amp; in direct &amp; indirect taxation. I am passionate about digital marketing &amp; gained a lot of knowledge about it. I also learned Photo editing, Logo design, Website, blogging, Content &amp; copywriting.</p><p><br></p><p>We are a team of three. Each one of us is an expert in our own field.</p><p>Primary Team:</p><p>I am planning to connect with more professionals who is willing to join me in this venture &amp; support new Entrepreneur.</p><p>Secondary Team:&nbsp;</p><p>the Second team is paid interns Who are willing to learn practically in their particular Niche. They are working under the guidance of the Primary team. &amp; also get certified after completion of their internship.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Part-time team</p><p>We would like to collaborate with professionals with other states of India. these professionals can get connect with their locals &amp; work on our project while doing their own work.</p>","industries":["Professional & Commercial Services"],"name":"Start It Up","sectors":["Business Support Services"]},{"email":"ojhavanita@gmail.com","idea":"<p>We are a Leading Recruitment Firm.
