I have designed a mobile application named \"Sabka Designer\". I want all designers of India to find a common ground where they can easily find clients and/or do freelancing work. It is still work in progress as I don't have enough money to build a perfect application , but I have tried to build something which resonates with my idea. Being myself a designer, I have gone through numerous problems in my career , such as lack of respect for designers , consistent income etc. So I hope this idea of mine will create so many more opportunities for designers as well as for myself.
