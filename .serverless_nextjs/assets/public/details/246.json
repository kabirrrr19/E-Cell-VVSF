We've developed an innovative open-source telemedicine platform that's improving access to primary health care in underserved regions of the world. We've developed an innovative and redefining open-source telemedicine platform collaboratively at The Johns Hopkins Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design (CBID), that's improving access to primary health care though an expert system powered Telemedicine platform for task shifting, enhancing and transforming delivery system through Frontline Healthcare workers in underserved regions of the world like India, Bangladesh, Africa, etc.\n</p><p>Our technology is free and open source – so any organization can use it and adapt it to meet their needs. Our approach is built on United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3, 9 &amp; 17) - Good Health &amp; Wellbeing; Industry, Innovation &amp; Infrastructure and Partnerships for the goals. We have released this transformational technology as a digital public good built on the Principles for Digital Development.\n</p><p>A novel digital assistant, called Ayu, that contains evidence-based protocols for delivering high-quality health services and improved patient outcomes. Ayu supports task-shifting of complex protocols such as clinical history taking, physical examination, screening, etc., to local health workers like nurses, midwives, and community health workers. For conditions beyond the capacity of the health worker + digital assistant, she can connect with a virtual doctor over telemedicine to develop a management plan for the patient. Through a digital assistant + telemedicine, we ensure that the right medical expertise is made available, even when the expert can’t physically be present. Ayu has history taking and baseline screening examination protocols covering 88 conditions and 143 basic examinations. Additionally, Ayu supports the integration of low-cost portable point of care diagnostic equipment. Health workers can facilitate teleconsultations with primary care physicians and specialists &amp; then connect the patient with a nearby pharmacy for medications, significantly reducing the patient’s time, distance, and money to access care. The app is available in multiple languages, can work offline and in very low bandwidth. Using Ayu and telemedicine support, health workers can address 70% of primary care conditions of people living in rural areas in India. It has been used for a wide range of conditions such as telemedicine-based management of high-risk pregnancies; screening, diagnosis, and management of NCDs; diagnosis of coronary artery disease; remote physiotherapy for patients with arthritis. It enables patients to receive health care services like screening, counseling, access to diagnostic tests &amp; medicines, appropriate referrals to hospitals, health education &amp; awareness, in a single location. Health data collected using Intelehealth’s digital assistant is stored in a longitudinal Electronic Health Record system (OpenMRS). It can be integrated into health information systems allowing for real-time disease surveillance, empowering policy-makers to make data-driven decisions</p><p> \n</p><p> \n</p>","industries":["Social Impact"],"name":" TELEHEALTH INNOVATIONS  FOUNDATION","sectors":["NGO"]},{"email":"nikhilmarlecha@gmail.com","idea":"<p>STUPA KERAMOS is a family-run business dedicated to providing excellent  space designing</p><p>solutions  with innovative and distinctive product range in the  Retail and Construction  &amp; Turn-</p><p>key project segments.
