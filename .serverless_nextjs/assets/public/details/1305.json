However, traditional methods used in dairy farming have together rendered  per person Milch animals  low and Milk yield average of the animals to be minuscule per person. \n</div><div>It is rare to find a dairy farmer starting afresh with 1-2 milch animals reaching up to 10 animals within 4-5 years.  It is though, common to see someone having 50 animals today and reducing the business to only 10 animals within few years. \n</div><div>Indian retail consumer is denied clean high quality milk even though he’s ready to pay high price for the same. \n</div><div>Considering the win-win situation for both when you connect the two dots, we entered the space with our website powergotha.com. Initially it was launched only in Marathi, which now we are happy to bring out in English and Hindi.  The target audience for PowerGotha is obviously the common Dairy farmer. \n</div><div>Schooling system in India teaches you all including History, Geography and Maths but they never teach you skill building or useful techniques in Professions such as agriculture or animal rearing. We are here to fill the void. \n</div><div>The less number of technical words we use the better it is for farmer to understand.  More the photos and videos the merrier\n</div><div>Young farmers learning few things from us and implementing them, will take India up there with advanced nations in terms of milk quality and quantity. \n</div><div>It was our duty to use the penetration of mobiles and internet to carry out the knowledge distribution and social transformation.  The very reason why PowerGotha was borne. \n</div><div>The website had laid the foundation and our Android app is going to take it further in big way. \n</div><div>Profit/loss in Dairy, Goat and Backyard Poultry Farming \n</div><div>The farmers practicing Dairy, goat or backyard poultry farming generally face many hiccups, which need timely intervention and guidance.  Quality guidance is a rare thing to find in these fields.\n</div><div>Lack of precise knowledge of doing things the right way is one of the main reasons why Animal husbandry isn’t profitable in India for general public. The same needs to be addressed. \n</div><div>PowerGotha.com is trying hard to contribute in this cause.  The website is functioning under guidance of Dr Shailesh Madane and other reputed experts in the field of animal husbandry.\n</div><div>Dr Madane has been teaching cost-effective, modern yet simple dairy farming techniques the dairy farmers through his lectures and seminars.  He has even had a stint with Govt of Maharashtra to disburse dairy farming knowledge.  \n</div><div>The Website was started with a view to reach people who haven’t had access to Dr Madane’s seminars.  It is also a source of additional info and revision to those who had attended such trainings.  Now, the website is reaching all corners of India through English and Hindi.   We are happy to announce that, all the content from the website will also be available through our app also. \n</div><div>We are committed to cause of profitable dairy farming and animal rearing as a main source of income for Indian farmer.  Supporting these professions through money, hard work and knowledge, planning and management will pave a way to a better India. \n</div><div>Powergotha.com website has had a great success and support from you all.  We wish the app also succeeds the same way and brings out best among Indian farmers. \n</div><div>With a dream in our eyes, we shall be marching ahead always.</div>","industries":["Pets & Animals"],"name":"POWERGOTHA MANAGEMENT SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"rahulakapoor@gmail.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Finance Technology"],"name":"PEAKPROFITS CAPITAL CONSULTANCY PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Advisory"]},{"email":"mail.ravir@gmail.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"LAGOM LABS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Health & Wellness"]},{"email":"dheerankur@ihaat.in","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Retail"],"name":"DUAM TECHNOLOGY PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Retail Technology"]},{"email":"nikunj@urbanplace.in","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Real Estate"],"name":"URBO VENTURES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Housing"]},{"email":"sanjay.s@gemsskills.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Education"],"name":"GEMS SKILLS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Skill Development"]}]
