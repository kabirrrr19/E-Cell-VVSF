As this segment is at a very nascent stage in India and still setting up the necessary infrastructure to grow, we feel this is the right time and the market size for us to enter and plug the gap that exists in ownership experience post-purchase of vehicles. The owners at present have limited options in services available after buying Electric Vehicle w.r.t. its servicing, maintenance, upkeep / upgradation, charging infrastructure, insurance processing and other auxiliary services. We hope to create an app + web-based platform where we hope to bring together these providers and connect them to the owners at the right time and price. This also gives us a unique opportunity to impart and upgrade the necessary maintenance know-how to maintain an Electric Vehicle and work with the entire chain of processes in close collaboration.
