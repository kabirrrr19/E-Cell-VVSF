Surface preparation has various cleaning swedish standards. It is done by blasting the surfaces using different materials such as copper slag, grit, shot, garnets, etc. with the help of compressors and hoppers. It is done to get a cleaned surface according to the Swedish standards so we get adhesion of these coatings to the steel surfaces. Anti corrosive coatings increases the life of steel structures in the above mentioned industries by protecting them from corrosion.These coatings are applied with the help of various types of airless spray coating machines. If these services are not done on a regular basis, it may lead to major catastrophic events. So, it is very much mandatory for these coatings to be done on a regular basis across the globe. Fire proofing coatings are done to provide protection to the steel surfaces from fire during any fire accidents. For eg: we apply these coatings for 2 hour rating systems on the steel surfaces and if there is any fire incident, these coatings will protect the steel from fire for 2 hours giving us time to control the incident, evacuate the area, etc. It is mandatory to be done in residential/commercial buildings, offshore platforms, refineries, etc.</p>","industries":["Others"],"name":"GLOBAL TECH INFRA PROJECTS PVT LTD","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"ACCOUNTING@NETBENEFITLTD.COM","idea":"<p>NetBenefit Ltd. is the brainchild of the COVID-19 pandemic.
