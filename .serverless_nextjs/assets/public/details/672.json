You can usually find me working away in my little home studio Mumbai. That’s where all of my pieces are individually designed, sculpted, stamped, baked, and packaged by hand. I'm a Interior Designer by trade, with a Degree in Interior Design, but I’ve always had a passion for making things with my hands.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>When I began Happy Sisters Studio, I was in search of a way to keep my hands busy, and I’d seen so many videos of people creating fun little polymer clay charms on YouTube. but soon realised I’m not much of a realism sculptor. Almost accidentally the marbled, customisation earrings were born! Since that day I have refined my work to a mostly neutral colour palette with organic unique shapes. I’ve also expanded to include Macrame with polymer clay and in hair accessories and hope to continue to explore this medium. Polymer clay is totally limitless when it comes to designs, so I’m constantly thinking of new ways to use it.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Thanks for coming a long on this journey with me!</p>","industries":["Fashion"],"name":"Happy Sisters Studio","sectors":["Jewellery"]},{"email":"prasad@aajicare.in","idea":"<p>“Aarambh” an Elder care home is a new generation thought for the growing need for allied seniors who are becoming dissocialized due to the fast moving life of their children, growing nuclear family, career prospects.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>It also serves patients who are in dire need for an extended stay for a multipurpose rehabilitation [Physical and psychological] after discharge from hospital.
