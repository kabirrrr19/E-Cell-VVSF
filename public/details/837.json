This brand from Mumbai is co-founded by two sisters, Meghna Kishore and Barkha Bhatnagar Das who have a strong sense of purposeful living and environmental consciousness. With a collective work experience of over 35 years in the financial sector, they decided to give up their corporate careers to drive a change in the kids’ apparel industry. Deeply concerned about the health issues associated with the use of synthetic fabrics in kids’ clothing and the environmental impact of these fabrics, the two set out to produce high-quality, fun and vibrant kidswear which is sustainable and 100% certified organic.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Synthetic fabrics have been known to cause health concerns. Children’s skin is significantly thinner and hence more absorbent of substances present in their clothes. Kids are thereby, prone to absorb the harmful chemicals and toxins present in their garments leading to skin rashes, allergies, respiratory disorders, auto-immune diseases etc. On the other hand, organic cotton is devoid of harmful chemicals which makes it less likely to trigger any allergies in children.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Apart from the health hazards, synthetic garments take a long time to decompose, creating long-term pollution. They also account for the pollution of water bodies as harmful waste from the production process gets flushed into these. All this harms the environment and dangerous toxins make way into our food chain causing health issues.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>With a strong belief that preservation of the planet is critical and it is the small steps which add up to conserving Mother Earth, Greendigo ensures that the garments are certified by Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) which affirms the organic status of raw materials as well as guarantees that manufacturing processes are environmentally and socially responsible. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>The brand understands that an outdoorsy lifestyle is paramount for the wellbeing of kids which is why their garments are machine washable, hardwearing and practical. Greendigo’s clothes are capsule wardrobe friendly and their range includes everyday essentials such as leggings, tees, polos, light jackets, dresses etc. which make mix and match a whole lot of fun. They ship worldwide and offer free shipping all across India.</p>","industries":["Textiles & Apparel"],"name":"GREENDIGO RETAIL PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Apparel & Accessories"]},{"email":"Sheroy@crown.vet","idea":"<p>Crown Vet is Mumbai’s newest health care facility dedicated to pet animals.

There is a lack of awareness about the various career opportunities and at this stage they are easily influenced by counselors, parents and friends. It does not give the students exposure to various unorthodox and unique career pathways in the world, only a few are exposed to them at the time of decision making. As stated in the Hindu Times 2016, 86% of students are concerned about which option to choose for higher education. In this way the child’s interest remains untapped. According to a National Human Resource Report, 53% of Indians today are not taking up careers of their interest.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, Pathway is an initiative working on a system that eases the process of choosing career pathways for students by giving them a gamified experience of the career before making decisions. We believe that a system that gives students a gist of various careers would boost their confidence. Furthermore, this will enable the students to pick careers of their choice, which will lead them to be happier.</p><p></p><p>Pathway is a Board game which simulates the journey of an individual in a career.
