[{"email":"remedtechnologies@gmail.com","idea":"<p><a target=\"_blank\">WRITE UP FOR START UP REGISTRATION Remed Care Technologies LLP (RCT) is founded on Research intensive innovative technologies developed by the Partners in the area of healthcare, biotechnology, resource conservation and related fields. RCT aims to convert R&amp;D output to manufacturing technology and systems, implement on a commercial scale, to market, sale &amp; lease the manufactured products and/or the processes. One of the products is ready for deployment the commercial domain for marketing the products within India and abroad. RCT also generates intellectual property assets as well as conducts commerce in related intellectual property, equipment, components, materials, and facility. While RCT directly commercialises a few technology based on own intellectual property, the rest is transferred to interested buyers on mutually acceptable commercial terms. The overall portfolio includes but is not limited to medical devices for therapy and diagnosis, biotechnology and chemical technology related products, sensors, special materials and components for the devices, etc. Remed Care Technologies LLP (RCT) is presently focused on three projects of Medical Devices based on technologies developed by the entrepreneurs, namely, 1)\tRobust Portable Medical Oxygen Concentrator (RPMOC) 2)\tNovel Negative Pressure Wound Therapy System (RCTVAC) 3)\tWater conservation in the Haemodialysis Machine The patent for the RPMOC is being filed. For RCTVAC and the water conservation equipment for Haemodialysisthe patent will be filed in a few months. The USP in both the devices is that it is based on entirely indigenous technologies with the components sourced within the country. Some materials are imported as they are so far not presently manufactured in the country. However, they can be procured from multiple sources. The technology of the medical device, Robust Portable Medical Oxygen Concentrator is at the Technology Readiness Level 6 and 7. Ten prototype units are being readied for field trials. The new technology is suitable for hospitals and nursing homes located in remote areas, where power outages could be frequent. One of the versions of RPMOC is also suitable for ambulances. It is robust to operate in the bumpy roads with dust, humidity and the usual pollutants in the Indian cities. The tropical climate environment is a challenge to most imported Oxygen concentrators, which makes the overall cost of O&amp;M high. This deficit is addressed in the novel technology developed by the Start Up RCT. The device is simple to operate without constant operator attention. Because of sourcing of the major components within India, it is offered at competitive prices. RPMOC has acquired a greater significance in face of the Pandemic of Covid-19. The second product RCTVAC is at the Technology Readiness Level 2-3. Negative pressure wound therapy is proven a better alternative to conventional dressing wound therapy. However, it is not common because of high cost to patients. RCTVAC addresses the high cost of a better system for wound therapy. With a highly innovative negative pressure wound therapy machine the cost will be substantially lowered. This device simultaneously addresses the microbial contamination of the machine and also the exhaust air which results in cross infection in the ward. The device is made simple to be operated and maintained by the hospital staff. The third product is aimed at reducing the water requirement for a single session of four hours of Haemodialysis from 300 litres to a mere 25 litres. This is a technology for the first time anywhere and has undergone extensive experimentation over several months. Presently it is in the Technology Readiness Level 4. Besides choosing areas of societal relevance for technology development the Start Up also engages in capacity building in technology in the Society. RCT has adopted a model of carrying the capacity building in a sustainable manner. These include: a)\tEstablishing own Government recognized laboratories and conducting research in the areas to  promote national and United Nation’s vision in science and technology in the service of mankind. b)\tGenerating ideas, train and intern young scientists, engineers and technical professionals from industry and to organize workshops/seminars/training in the emerging areas of frontier science and technology and also provide educational consultancy and training. c)\tUndertaking societal outreach programs of skill up gradation through manpower training in the fields of resource conservation, medical devices, chemical and manufacturing industry.</a><br></p>","industries":["Technology Hardware"],"name":"REMED CARE TECHNOLOGIES LLP","sectors":["Manufacturing"]},{"email":"salutarefoodproductspvtltd@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Agriculture has always been the backbone of our country.
