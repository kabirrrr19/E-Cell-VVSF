At Quinton Air &amp; Odor Management (AOM), we recognize healthy indoor air to be a&nbsp;</span><span>basic right and hence have developed innovative solutions to address this challenge.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span>ASHRAE Standards have confirmed that the breathing or respiratory zone is defined as “the&nbsp;</span><span>area from which an individual draws air and has been defined as being as close as possible&nbsp;</span><span>to the nose and mouth and a this is defined as a height between 4 feet to 6 feet from floor&nbsp;</span><span>level.</span></div><div>Most of the air cleaners used regularly indoors are installed at the floor level. These do not&nbsp;<span>have the power to draw in the air from a height of 4-6 feet and hence are not effective air&nbsp;</span><span>purification models.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span>ACH stands for Air Changes per Hour, and is arguably the most important factor in air&nbsp;</span><span>purification. An ACH rating tells us how many times an air purifier filters all of the air in a&nbsp;</span><span>given room during one hour. However, for most of the systems currently available, the ACH&nbsp;</span><span>is static i.e the ACH has no correlation to the current particle load in the room.</span></div><div>Thirdly, for all it is worth, all the currently marketed air cleaners systems only capture the&nbsp;<span>particles which would also include bacteria but there is no provision of elimination.</span></div><div><br></div><div>We at Quinton Air and Odor Management have developed a unique solution for the first&nbsp;<span>time in the world which address all of the above lacunae. </span></div><div><span>Our system:</span></div><div>1. Cleans and purifies air at the “breathing zone”</div><div>2. It purifies particles upto the size of 0.5 micron which results in elimination of most&nbsp;<span>bacteria</span></div><div>3. It is a dynamic system – the integrated system measures the particle load and&nbsp;<span>changes the ACH based on the particle load</span></div><div>4. With our unique nanotechnology product, all the bacteria captured by the system is&nbsp;<span>eliminated.</span></div><div>This is only our first development and we are concurrently working on developing&nbsp;<span>comprehensive solutions in air and odor management for hospitals, pharmaceutical clean&nbsp;</span><span>rooms, offices, homes, etc. In doing&nbsp;</span>so, we will cater to almost every air quality need and&nbsp;<span>will definitely serve as the missing piece in our environment or premises.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Here at AOM, our philosophy is a great life begins with clean air.</div>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"QUINTON AIR &amp; ODOR MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Healthcare Technology"]},{"email":"rsrao88@gmail.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Renewable Energy"],"name":"RAVENT RENEWABLES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Renewable Energy Solutions"]},{"email":"sanjay.kasturia@ativitti.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["AI"],"name":"ATIVITTI AI TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Machine Learning"]},{"email":"s.agarkar@edu360.co","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["AR VR (Augmented + Virtual Reality)"],"name":"EDU360 KnowLEDGE SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"info@teacultureoftheworld.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"TCW TEA PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Food Processing"]},{"email":"sujalpatwardhan@embarq.in","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Travel & Tourism"],"name":"EMBARQ MOTORWORLD PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Experiential Travel"]},{"email":"hkaria22@gmail.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"CORVUS INTERNATIONAL FOODS LLP","sectors":["Food Processing"]}]
