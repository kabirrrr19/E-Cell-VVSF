The solution leverages Visa and Mastercard’s HCE tokenisation standards (VTS/MDES).</span></p><p>In addition, we have also included Ecash and Loyalty solutions using the Blockchain technology. The beauty of this solution is that the card uses EMV rails which means along with P2P money transfers, the card can also be used for NFC payments in the stores, just like a Visa/Mastercard cards - this is a very unique solution enabling merchants to allow their loyalty points/vouchers/gift cards to be used in the retail store as mobile NFC payment.&nbsp;</p><p>The key USP of our solution is the PKI digital signature security layer that we have added to protect our end-to-end solution and provide strongest possible 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) and non-repudiation of transactions, making ourselves the World's first HCE solution provider to use PKI security tool to provide the most secured mobile payments solution in the market. We decided to design the solution to not only adhere to the mandatory PCI-DSS, HCE and UPI standards, but to go beyond by implementing an additional layer of security in the form of Wireless Public Key Infrastructure (WPKI) based Digital IDs. WPKI acts as a security layer assigning our host technology platform and each consumer mobile device with own digital ID and signature. This not only ensures non-repudiation, but also user and device authentication and secure end-to-end communication between the mobile wallet client and the Host. The security is further strengthened with the use of software Whitebox Cryptography that protects the Digital ID tokens, along with other sensitive keys and EMV tokens.</p>","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"HCE Secure IT Services Pvt Ltd","sectors":["Product Development"]},{"email":"subrata.khuntia@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Webtouch Private Limited has recently conceptualised &amp; ventured into Solar Project Developments.&nbsp;</p><p>The Indian Solar Industry is growing at &gt;60%YoY since last 3 years.
