We have create an online system PBILL on the similar lines of CIBIL , where-in a CIBIL score reflects the credit history of an individual and a CIBIL check via the PAN number of the individual is usually done before lending , similarly a PBIIL score will reflect about the professional work history of an individual which can be searched instantly via Aadhar number before hiring&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>3.) There are some specific industries like Last Mile Delivery , Courier , Warehouse , Logistic , Digital Lending , NBFC , EMI Collections , Security , Housekeeping etc , where manpower hiring is done in large volume because of high demand + high attrition levels.&nbsp; Because of urgency to full-fill the hiring demand ,usually the background checks are done after the resource is on-boarded .&nbsp; Our technology platform offers seamless online access and API integration for on-the-spot verification with-in seconds&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>4.) Existing background checks available in the market are expensive and take 2-90 days for various levels of check. 90% of the mishaps like theft etc by the hired resource usually happens during the same period .&nbsp; Here our platform comes very handy as it gives a preliminary report based on our proprietary database within seconds , giving the much required sign of caution to the employer at the time of hiring itself&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>5.)
