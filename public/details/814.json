Also, 65% of the deaths that occur in our country are caused due to the collision of trucks in an accident.\nThrough real time intervention in their local language we will help truck drivers make safer choices on the road, lower their chances of meeting with accidents, and connect this largely fragmented network to foster a sense of community and make them prosperous members of society.  \nBackground:\nStatistics\nSeverity of the national issue in our country -\nAccording to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, on the Indian roads there are around 5 lakh accidents every year, resulting in 2,00,000 deaths, on an average India records about 400 deaths a day. \nAccording to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) More than 65% of the accidents happen on National Highways, 50% of the victims are below the age of 35 years.\nThese accidents and deaths account for nearly 3% of our GDP, it is a national issue which isn’t given the attention it deserves.\nBreakdown of the types of truck drivers in the industry\nAccording to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, 2013\nFollowing is the ownership pattern of trucks in India:\n-\t80% of the fleet is with those who own 1 to 5 trucks (Single Fleet Owners – Chalak Malaks)\n-\t15% of the fleet is with those who own 6 to 20 trucks (Medium Sized Fleets)\n-\t5% of the fleet is with those who own more than 20 trucks (Large Sized Fleets)\nSafety devices which usually flag violations such as over-speeding, sleep deprivation among many others, typically cost a great deal of money (more than 20-30,000 for GPS and sleep detection) and only a small number of the 10% of the large fleet owners have access to these.\nOver 95% of the trucking industry don’t have the means to technologies around safety. \nDue to the lack of awareness, availability and affordability, safety remains an afterthought\n(the 95% figure is a guestimate according to the data source mentioned above along with our own observation over the years in the industry)\n\nThe unaddressed problem at the grass roots\nIn India, the last decade has seen large pool of funds being invested in the logistic space. These investments have largely been for solutions focusing on the freight aggregation business, Black Buck and Rivigo are the best-known examples of this, but there are many other smaller players. While most companies in the Logistics domain are focusing on tracking the consignment and improving operational efficiency, the most critical constituent of logistic business - the Driver is ignored. There is no thought given to drivers’ well-being and safety which has a direct implication towards these operational inefficiencies.\nThe marginalised and neglected player: the Indian truck driver\nBased on our interactions with about 180 drivers we have interviewed through our qualitative and quantitative research conducted by our team, following are the insights we have gathered\n-\tCorrupt and Unjust Government Authorities\nThe drivers have to face harassment and exploitation throughout their journey, it starts with law enforcement authorities (cops who threaten and force these drivers into paying bribes and unauthorized tolls that extort money from them). A driver we recently interviewed in Pune who had driven from Jodhpur informed us that in tolls and bribes alone he had to pay over Rs 9,000 which after further investigation we discovered isn’t even considered to be an alarming sum.\n-\tBlame on the truck driver regardless of whether he’s right or not\nIn case of an accident, even if it is not the truck driver’s fault, he is manhandled by the crowd and in some cases even beaten to death, it is assumed that he is always at fault.\n-\tSleep deprivation\nAccording to NHAI, only 3% accidents are caused due to drunkenness while more than 20% are caused due to sleep deprivation. Contrary to the popular misconception, most accidents are caused due to sleep deprivation and not due to driving in an intoxicated condition. \nThe lack of clean and secure amenities leads to poor sleeping and resting conditions. Even a 5-hour sleep is at the cost of theft of diesel, vehicle components and even the goods in his carrier could be stolen. As a result, he is forced to drive exhausted\n-\tCSR outreach has limitations\nSince the driver is always in transit, it’s difficult to keep track of where the drivers are and measuring impact for the funds allotted by companies for their welfare.\nThis issue causes problems since even companies who want to do good for their drivers aren’t able to do so.\n-\t¬Driver training\nCurrently there are a few good driver training academies (Tata, Ashok Leyland, etc) however in case of single-fleet owners, the cleaners (or the ‘Khalasi’) is trained under the driver as an apprentice who eventually goes on to become a driver. \nSo, if the driver is a good one, he shall pass on the goo</p>","industries":["Safety"],"name":"Good mind pvt ltd","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"deepak@reinforceresources.com","idea":"<p>We would like to introduce myself as entrepreneurs who have passion for water conservation.
