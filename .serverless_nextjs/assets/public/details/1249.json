This is done by creating 'platforms'\n</div><div>where the government, citizens and experts interact and problem- solve together,\n</div><div>whereby creating the synergy necessary to bring about change.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Recity focuses on the following agendas within Urban development:\n</div><div><br></div><div>• Waste Management: Solid waste management is one of the most basic essential services\n</div><div>provided by municipal authorities. However, it is among the most poorly rendered services\n</div><div>– the systems applied are unscientific, outdated and inefficient. It is estimated that India will\n</div><div>have to invest close to US$11 billion in solid waste management alone over the next 20\n</div><div>years. RECITY’s engagement with citizen groups and government bodies like APMC, Navi\n</div><div>Mumbai Municipal Corporation and Ambala Municipal Corporation has helped it create city\n</div><div>level integrated solutions for Waste Collection, segregation, disposal and monitoring.\n</div><div><br></div><div>• Water Resilience: Water resources and related infrastructure usually emphasizes the\n</div><div>need to be resilient, secure and sustainable. In the Indian context, where we have large\n</div><div>ground to cover, this means that we need a system that encompasses practical policymaking,\n</div><div>implementable infrastructure solutions, citizen participation, and monitoring and\n</div><div>evaluation systems to save and harvest water and also route this water back to the citizens\n</div><div>during disruptive events. This requires social as well as technical engineering, and a\n</div><div>movement like RECITY to enable the complex interactions between the citizenry,\n</div><div>government, and the technological experts.\n</div><div><br></div><div>• Sanitation: Recity brings together government, private sector, NGOs, multi &amp; bilateral,\n</div><div>foundations, trusts, civil society and citizens at large to create synergies to work towards\n</div><div>the entire sanitation value chain. We implement behavior change communication, design\n</div><div>end to end infrastructure solutions, citizen participation, develop citizen feedback solutions\n</div><div>and help ULBs to set up monitoring and evaluation systems</div>","industries":["Professional & Commercial Services"],"name":"RECITY NETWORK PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Environmental Services & Equipment"]},{"email":"tauseef.tpk@gmail.com","idea":"WE ARE AN ONLINE SHOWCASE OF PROPERTIES FOR BENEFIT OF CONSUMERS AS WELL AS BUILDERS<br>","industries":["Real Estate"],"name":"A &amp; O Ventures Private Limited","sectors":["Housing"]},{"email":"avioncorp1001@gmail.com","idea":"<a href=\"http://avioncorporation\" target=\"_blank\">Non destructive testing</a><br>","industries":["Others"],"name":"Avion Industrial Corporation","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"ebullient.automation@gmail.com","idea":"<p>We have an idea to create a Home Automation System in such a way that it saves at least 30-40% of the basic wiring of a home.&nbsp;</p><p>The solution would be affordable by even lower-middle-class population while providing state-of-the-art features like Alexa and Google Home compatibility along with mobile app operations for simple light controls to geyser or microwave or boiler controls to capacitor fan controls to complex dimming solutions to curtain controls and IR + RF controls and much more.</p><p><br></p><p>If this idea is implemented by everyone in India, a huge amount of Copper wiring can be saved.
