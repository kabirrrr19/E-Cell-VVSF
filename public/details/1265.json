A disruptive universal consumer centric care platform integrated across software, devices and doctors.</p><p>Clinivantage Healthcare is a company with global presence, operating in 6 countries delivering a disruptive platform for creating connected healthcare ecosystem. Clinivantage delivers all its solutions and services through Platform as a Service (PaaS) model with connected healthcare ATMs &amp; devices. \n</p><div>Clinivantage has strong domain experience in the healthcare; with a team experienced in delivery of “last mile care”. The company has gained global recognition for its technology that transforms illness to wellness management. Clinivantage has unique implementation of service offerings, software and IoT medical devices to deliver public centric healthcare. Clinivantage makes healthcare accessible and affordable for the masses, in rural and urban areas through existing public &amp; private infrastructure, with no new capital infrastructure investments across geographies.</div><div><br></div><div>Clinivantage solutions are focused across various chronic diseases like diabetes, COPD, blood pressure, cardiac condition, TB, women’s health, children health and also across various habits of smoking, alcohol and nutrition or mal nutrition.  Clinivantage has delivered healthcare in “last mile” with execution of digital, connected OPD session, dispensing of medicines and executing successful radiology solutions across rural and urban areas.</div><div><br></div><div>IoT devices of Clinivantage are capable of performing various operations such as calculation of BMI, heart rate, SpO2, ECG, blood sugar etc. It’s other devices are capable of measuring vitamins and micro minerals in the blood without taking out any blood using only electro acupuncture technique. This can greatly help in areas prone to malnutrition and enable government to provide the right nutrition to the children and improve infant mortality rates. All the screening can be done by capturing the data into the platform’s system through apps. The results can be viewed by the doctors who can guide the patients from any location for right medication, advanced tests or admission to the hospitals for further treatment.</div><div><br></div><div>The healthcare system in India faces several key challenges in the last mile: a fragmented delivery system; primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care fractured from one another. Healthcare delivery in India is organized from tertiary care to primary care, rather than the other way around. The ability to deliver appropriate patient centered care will be an important step for India to provide high quality health services at a cost Government and citizen can afford. The pressures on cost are increasing due to lifestyle and demographic changes, most specifically the increased cost of caring for chronic care and aging populations. Universal healthcare coverage is not sufficient to address the twin challenges of high quality and affordability. Access alone guarantees neither quality or affordability.</div><div><br></div><p></p>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"CLINIVANTAGE HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Health & Wellness"]},{"email":"jagannath.nikam@devopstech.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"DEVOPSTECH SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["IT Management"]},{"email":"abhilash@ayurcliniq.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"SYSTEMIC AYURVEDIC RESEARCH PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Health & Wellness"]},{"email":"aaditya.damani@gmail.com","idea":"Yet to be updated","industries":["Internet of Things"],"name":"AUTOSYS INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Manufacturing & Warehouse"]}]
