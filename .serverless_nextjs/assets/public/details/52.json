Our team wanted to manufacture electric vehicles which will be better, quicker, more fun to drive than conventional fuel driven vehicles. We believe the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.\n</p><p><br></p><p>We're a retrofitting kit manufacturer based out of India. Retrofication is the process of replacing traditional technology with an advanced new era technology. Just Electric replaces the Internal Combustion (IC) engines and its accompanying components with an electric motor to transform the conventional fuel driven vehicles to all new electric vehicles. Not only the price and maintenance cost of the kits are pocket friendly, but they are environment friendly too. Our kit helps achieve 0% direct emissions which reduces the air pollution and makes Earth a better place to live in. Just Electric is continuously making efforts to make our products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy. Electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.</p><p>\n</p>","industries":["Automotive"],"name":"INNOWHIZ ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Electric Vehicles"]}]
