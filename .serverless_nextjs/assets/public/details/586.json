The sensor will be a part of the PVRS and would maintain data on a server and relay real time information via our industry first hardware to the doctor so that we know  on daily basis , how many hours the patient has maintained prone position .The  sensor would be embedded in the headrest of the PVRS and can be used by the patient in sitting or in lying down position by simply detaching it from one device and attaching it to another . This is a novel device which would have a big impact in vitreo-retina services . \n</p><p>\n</p><p>If we are certain of the patient posture in the post operative period and also improve the patient compliance, surgeons would feel more confident shifting towards gas tamponade from silicone oil and it would decrease the morbidity related to silicone oil and the cost of re surgeries. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>PVRS becomes a temporary seating mechanism to help patients relax while writing, reading, eating, socializing or watching TV while facing down from Vitrectomy surgery. With a  2-Way angled  Mirror it is easier  to watch television On The Table, Desk or TV Tray.\n</p><p> \n</p><p>The P.V.R.S.  can be used on the top of a table or a desk as well. This is a great way to sit down with the family and yet still being able to face down. To us the PVRS on the table or a  desk, simply place the item on the table, while you are sitting on your own chair, lean towards the chest pad and place your head on the cushion. All the parts are adjustable. The PVRS  is completely adjustable for the widest variety of body types, sizes and other physical considerations. The PVRS  is very simple to use . No assembly or tools required .With a few quick and snappy adjustments, you will be able to set-up  in just a few minutes. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>With these 3 components which include a supportive posture maintenance device, an angled mirror and a sensor we can provide a very effective solution to our patients. This device will improve patient comfort and assist in quick recovery in the immediate post operative period  .</p>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"VISION CURE PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Medical Devices Biomedical"]},{"email":"sheetalkhare2@gmail.com","idea":"<p>White Egg trader in Ambernath.</p><p>just completed one month to the shop and I am noticing a very good response however I need extra finance to expand my business&nbsp;</p>","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"Eggzo International Enterprise","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"shashikantj651@gmail.com","idea":"<p>I am start new business , 5 lac loan required.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Required 36 month&nbsp;</p>","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"China man chinese corner &amp; fast food","sectors":["Food Processing"]},{"email":"goshantmeher@gmail.com","idea":"<p>In this world of E-commerce most affecting area are local stores.<br>With our product all local stores can connect to internet, it doesn't mater whether they sell goods or services.<br>With AI driven solution with highly engaging and two way communication.</p><p><br></p><p>What does our Product do?<br>1.Its just simple, Local stores can mange their inventory.
