[{"email":"anbambole@st.vjti.ac.in","idea":"<p>Paritta SHM is a startup focusing on providing system-integrated cost-efficient IoT-based structural health monitoring products and services for the existing and newly built structures.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Structural health monitoring can be described as the process of implementing a damage detection and characterization strategy for engineering structures. This field involves health monitoring, operational evaluation, data feature extraction, and statistical models development and is pertinent for every existing structure. The damage detection and characterization of the structure can be performed by measurement of displacement, acceleration, strain, cracks, tilt levels, temperature, comparison from photos taken at regular intervals, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The measurement of the health monitoring parameters is currently performed by expensive data acquisition systems and sensors. These systems and sensors are currently sold by multi-national companies in India through their local distributors. This practice has led to little or no after-sales support for the customers and provides a poor return on their expensive investment. In addition, these existing systems and software are limited to providing discontinuous data with no post-processing or interpretation on-site. The size and form factor of some of these data acquisition systems also makes them unviable to use on several projects with space limitations or severe weather environments. With the projection of an increase in demand for high-quality cost-efficient structural health monitoring in India, it is perinent to move from time-based maintenance to condition-based maintenance of the built environment. Additionally, it is also important to manufacture high quality products for health monitoring in the country to pursue the vision of AaatmaNirbhar Bharat. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Paritta SHM will assist in providing cost-efficient IoT-based sensors that will provide data interpretation on-site. This technology will provide on-demand reliable information pertaining to the safety and integrity of a structure. The warnings provided by the system for the measured structural distress will help to avert catastrophic failures. This startup consists of a unique team with a vision of providing its technology based on novelty, innovation and social aspect. The presence of in-house experts from diverse engineering fields will help this startup in fulfilling its long term goal of providing IoT-based cost-efficient products and services to the health monitoring field.&nbsp;</p>","industries":["Construction"],"name":"Paritta SHM","sectors":["Construction & Engineering"]},{"email":"shunyawasteliving@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Poultry Chicken Waste contributes greatly to waste production.
