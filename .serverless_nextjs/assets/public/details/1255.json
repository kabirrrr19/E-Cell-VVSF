Swacch Bharat as we understand is a behavioural change towards overall cleanliness. On that note we have come up with the idea of “Sachet Hand Sanitizer”. This product will be circulated amongst the mass Indian people to avoid hand spread diseases. The sachet will contain 1ml of hand sanitizer which can clean 99.99% of germs at a minimal cost of Re1.  Sachet hand sanitizer are not available in the local markets, making this product an Innovative product. \n<div>•\tIn the local market we get bottle sanitizers which are difficult to carry &amp; use and it is not pocket friendly which refrains people from regularly using sanitizers. \n</div><div>•\tIn India, major part of the  population prefers to have their meals with hands. The scalability of the business is humongous. Creating awareness through media, ngos and other social activities  will be the part of the business. Once the awareness is created the product can be sold from airlines  to local pan shops . It is a PAN india project which will create huge employment through distribution network from various walks of life, specially for the economically deprived people. We are in talks with various Ngos who are working on the ground level with Women who are economically weak. We would like to engage them and empower them by involving them in the business.</div>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"KD SANITIZATION PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Health & Wellness"]},{"email":"anil@z-aksys.com","idea":"<a href=\"http://z-aksys.com/about_us\" target=\"_blank\">About Z-Aksys</a><br>","industries":["Design"],"name":"Z-Aksys Solutions Pvt.
