Prior to occurrence of the pandemic, organizations were used to conventional employee on-boarding process. Through eDAS, we have innovatively designed a ‘Digital On-boarding Solution’. This is one of the ‘Best-in-Class’ solutions and unique in many ways since it comes as an End-to-End solution that is capable of managing the complete ‘HR On-boarding Cycle’ for any industry. Considering a situation of any force majeure or pandemic occurrence, any organization would not be faced with challenges of managing the HR on-boarding through ‘brick-and-mortar’ process. This solution helps in overcoming many such challenges as various stages of this value-chain can now be digitally handled, right from digital availability of candidate resumes, step-by-step tracking of candidate selection right up to offer letter being digitally signed and mailed across to the prospective candidate, amongst other features like digital attendance of the employee, leave management, etc.</p>","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"EUREKA DIGITISATION & AUTOMATION SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Application Development"]},{"email":"vijay@kjmcomputers.com","idea":"<p>KJM Computers Private Limited is an make in India product manufacturer of Desktop computers.</p>","industries":["Technology Hardware"],"name":"KJM COMPUTERS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Manufacturing"]},{"email":"shivamlandscapers@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Since 2013, Shivam Landscapers has been providing Consultancy for Road Development, Architects, Planners, Engineers, &amp; Project Consultants, Architectural and design, Civil Engineering Consultancy approved government contractors where it does a lot of civil construction work for MCGM (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) &amp; MBMC (Mira- Bhayander Municipal Corporation)an d VVCMC(Vasai–Virar City Municipal Corporation),Govt .of Maharashtra PWD (Public Work Department Mumbai),CIDCO Navi Mumbai ,Western Railway DRM Office Mumbai Central,Tata Housing Development Company Ltd, Private work at Lonavala etc</p>","industries":["Construction"],"name":"SHIVAM LANDSCAPERS","sectors":["Construction & Engineering"]},{"email":"devbhavsar2017@gmail.com","idea":"<p>A startup company with a vision towards innovating new designs, machines and procedure in automotive sector for giving a seamless experience to the driver who drives that vehicle with our design.&nbsp;</p>","industries":["Automotive"],"name":"Dev Auto World","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"rajendra@krishgen.com","idea":"<p>KRISHGEN PUDGALA LLP manufactuing&nbsp; Diagnostics test reagent / kits for Interleukin-6 (IL-6) ELISA</p>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"KRISHGEN PUDGALA LLP","sectors":["Biotechnology"]},{"email":"100rudrapay009@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Bill Payments.

The only option for such patients is the Fontan operation which is a palliative procedure that connects the superior vena cava (SVC) from the upper body and inferior vena cava (IVC) from the lower body directly with the pulmonary artery. However, at a later stage, the Fontan circulation tends to fail due to unequal distribution of the hepatic content-rich IVC blood to both the lungs resulting in the lung developmental problem. We are developing an implantable caval flow assist device that will standardize the surgery and regulate the blood flow thereby preventing the failing Fontan circulation.&nbsp;</p>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"AUFLOWS CARDIOTECH PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Medical Devices Biomedical"]},{"email":"sales@devcorp.co.in","idea":"<p>Dealers of Premium Quality Dates and Dryfruits.&nbsp; healthy and Tasty snacking for all. want to bridge the gap between wholesalers and buyers</p>","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"Dev Corp","sectors":["Food Processing"]},{"email":"gurit@davaninja.com","idea":"<p>DVNJ Health Tech is a recently registered Private Limited company which focuses on software solutions for healthcare and medicines.</p>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"DVNJ Health Tech PVT LTD","sectors":["Healthcare IT"]}]
