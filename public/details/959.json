Relaxo, Paragon, Aqualite, VKC) selling basic sheet cut products priced between ₹49-399, which are both uncomfortable and inappropriate for outdoor use. On the other hand, choices of comfortable flip flops are both limited (Crocs &amp; Skechers carrying only a limited selection of 4-6 styles each) and extremely expensive (₹2,999 - ₹4,999), making it unaffordable to most of the consumers. <br><br>Even as flip flops advance from being exclusively an at-home used footwear type to an everyday lifestyle product (casual wear, after sport, paired with shorts, travel etc), one cannot find a comfortable (cushioned footbed) pair of flip flops under ₹2,000. <br><br>Opportunity Size: India’s footwear market is estimated at US$ 7.5bn (2019e) with flip flops occupying a 12% share, US$ 900mn. Flip flops have outpaced footwear market growth by 3x over the last three years, growing at 30% YoY, making it the fastest growing footwear category in India. <br><br>Flip flop demand is estimated to remain strong, expanding by 22% YoY over the next five years growing to the market size of US$2bn by 2024.<br><br>How are we addressing this problem?: Chups, our private label flip flop brand, is India’s only flip flop brand which offers comfortable flip flops (cushioned footbed) under ₹1,500 (price range ₹499-1,499) addressing a large product gap in the market today. Chups uses several proprietary technologies such as footbeds made of real yoga mats and cooling gel footbeds. Our products are amongst the more comfortable available across the market while still priced under ₹1,499. <br><br>Additionally, we run India’s only specialty flip flop retail outfit, Flip Flop Hub, offering all types of flip flops under one roof. Flip Flop Hub is present in multiple formats such as stores, kiosks and Shop in Shops in 25 locations across the country.<br>","industries":["Fashion"],"name":"EASY SPIRIT ENTERPRISES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Lifestyle"]},{"email":"askvineet@gmail.com","idea":"Hotel that feels like home.","industries":["Travel & Tourism"],"name":"vineet upadhyay","sectors":["Hotel"]},{"email":"Byndoortravellers@gmail.com","idea":"A Tourism Business&nbsp;","industries":["Travel & Tourism"],"name":"ByndoorTravellers","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"technical@indiana-maritime.com","idea":"DEALING IN ALL TYPE OF SPARES AND STORES REQUIRED FOR VESSEL, RIGS, AND INDUSTRIAL USAGE.","industries":["Marketing"],"name":"INDIANA MARITIME PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Sales"]},{"email":"aryan@apna.co","idea":"We are creating an online smartphone-based platform for blue-collar and grey collar workers/ candidates. The purpose of the portal is to help these candidates find the best paying jobs suited to their skills and aptitude and help them upgrade their career and into a better life. Given the varying education levels and limited tech fluency of our target audience, the innovation comes from building an intuitive smartphone-based application which is language and education agnostic.

We are also innovating how the skills of the candidates can be verified intuitively in less than 2 mins through a proprietary methodology. Verification of skills ensures a seamless experience for both candidates and employers as both will interact with each other only if they're a fit between jobs and skills.","industries":["Professional & Commercial Services"],"name":"APNATIME TECH PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Business Support Services"]},{"email":"thanebazaar2019@gmail.com","idea":"ThaneBazaar is a platform for small individual entrepreneurs to sell their products online.
