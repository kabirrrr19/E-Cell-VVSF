Unlike Diabetes or Blood pressure where people have a reference range to understand if they have a health issue in the Movement Health space, there is complete lack of awareness amongst people as to whether they need therapy and when. It is only when people find it difficult to do daily tasks or have pain that they visit a physical therapist or orthopedic. In addition to this lack of awareness amongst people, shortage of skilled supply of caregivers and disjointed and or isolated user experiences are some of the major issues in this industry today.\n</p><p>In a nut shell there is no end to end digital tool which helps patients and caregivers manage the end to end lifecycle of the patient. In India, most records are saved on paper while in the US, care givers have to use 2-3 software solutions to maintain patient records, assign exercises and manage clinical functions. This results in poor patient experience and lack of adherence and visibility into how the treatment is progressing. Spry aims to facilitate value based interactions between patients and caregivers.</p>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"SPRY THERAPEUTICS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Health & Wellness"]}]
