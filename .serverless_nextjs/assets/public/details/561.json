The plethora of upcoming avenues and constantly changing dynamics of the working world makes guidance from parents and teachers obsolete. Moreover, 95% students of our country do not receive any formal guidance. Some cannot seek help due to financial problems or because they live in areas with no such facilities. Others who somehow do, find the services lacking despite the high costs.\n</p><p>The New Education Policy (NEP) 2020 stresses on the importance of vocational guidance. However, a recent report highlighted that 93% of Indian students know only about 7 career options and think of pursuing one of them due to family/peer/societal pressure, high competition or personal insecurities. Despite individual differences, everyone, regardless of being a parent or a student, find this decision taxing. What is sad is that financial and locational disparities are often emphasized in this situation because mentorship it its real sense doesnâ€™t exist in our country.\n</p><p>We, at Infigon Futures, strive to bring a change in this scenario and help everyone in desperate need of guidance. Everyone, despite their background and available resources deserve a chance to choose their own career and work towards pursuing their goals. Our aim is to turn this possibility into a reality.</p>","industries":["Education"],"name":"Infigon Futures ","sectors":["Others"]}]
