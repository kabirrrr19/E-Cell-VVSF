Their flagship product is&nbsp;Go Extended Warranty. They claim that their Extended Warranty program ensures that Customers are able to maintain their electronic products in top condition even in years 2, 3 &amp; 4 of the life of the product – long after the manufacturer’s warranty has expired.To put it simply, they charge Customers a small fee at the time of purchase of their new product, say a TV. The TV is covered by the manufacturer’s warranty in the First Year. However, in Second Year there is no warranty by the manufacturer. If something goes wrong with the TV, the Customer will have to do 2 things viz. they will have to take the pains to figure out the closest Service Center to log a call with them and also have to pay for the repairs and service charges associated with the malfunctioning TV. However, because the Customer had purchased the Go Warranty Service Plan at the time of purchase of TV, all the customer has to do is to call them. Not only do they visit the Customer at their home, but also pay all the charges that are incurred to repair the TV.Customers can buy the Go Warranty’s Extended Warranty plans from their website,&nbsp;www.GoWarranty.in&nbsp;or from any of their preferred partners like amazon.in. Apart from Extended Warranty, Go Warranty also have a couple of plans for mobile phones, tablets and laptops. Manufacturer’s warranty covers all routine problems occurring in the phone for the first 12 months of ownership of the phone. It does not cover any physical or liquid damage to the phone.</p>","industries":["Professional & Commercial Services"],"name":"GO WARRANTY & SERVICES LLP","sectors":["Business Support Services"]}]
