If you are an online retailer, it is important to find ways to succeed in the e-commerce world. New technologies, like IoT (Internet of Things) commerce, have created even more challenges and considerations for e-commerce businesses. Doing transactions online has made our lives easier; it’s faster, more efficient, and easier than buying in-store but There is a lot of information/data that is involved while dealing with eCommerce and a technical issue with data can cause severe damage to the retailer’s daily operations as well as brand image. E-commerce conversion margins are slim, so driving relevant traffic to site is crucial. Customer experience or user experience is key to a successful eCommerce website.The challenges of using technology to sell products and services to customers who can buy pretty much anything they want without ever leaving the comfort of their couch are real, but they're also opportunities. With the right eCommerce platform and programmatic marketing strategy, you can leverage your existing site traffic to turn online shoppers into paying customers.</p><p>E-commerce stores make the shopping experience easier than ever. When compared to shopping at traditional retail stores; however, what is missing is the implicit pressure one often feels to make a purchase when browsing for products. Shopping in an online store is not very different from shopping in a traditional retail store - you browse through an array of products, pick the ones you like and place them in your basket. Then you find out how much they cost and how much money you are willing to spend. But before you make up your mind to complete the purchase, think again… Getting a product delivered can be more expensive than buying it at the mall or in a store. For many people it has become not just about spending less time but also about getting better deals by purchasing on the Internet.</p>","industries":["Internet of Things"],"name":"WBV LIFESTYLE PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"naresh.kurapati82@gmail.com","idea":"<p>The company will be engaged in hospitalisation &amp; surgery assistance and all services related to healthcare.
