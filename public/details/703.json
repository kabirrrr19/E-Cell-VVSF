This abyss between the two ends had to be filled… and this is how Be Artistic was born. The venture aims to bridge the gap as we start laying the veritable bricks of creating a platform where the artist inside and outside you will be much closer than they are now.&nbsp;<span>Starting&nbsp;</span><span>from Art tech this application can be scaled to be inclusive of numerous other avenues.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p></p><p>Apps key functionality</p><p>•\tBe Artistic through a single app would help you learn sketching, painting, calligraphy and various other forms of art by step by step easy to learn tutorials.</p><p>•\tAs currently there is no Indian mainstream = app available for people interested in art, where users on a single platform can learn so many different forms of art</p><p>•\tThese art forms are selected in a way to keep in line with the subjects taught in art schools</p><p>•\tIt will also have an option to study the theory of art, as it is important to understand the origin, history and the influence that art form had on this world, which will widen the knowledge of the user</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>Revenue Model</p><p>•\tIn app advertising</p><p>•\tSubscription services</p><p>•\tIn app purchases</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>Why would people like to use it?</p><p>•\tAs it will save time, save search effort which usually shortens the actual time of practice, progressive learning, know the history and artists behind what they are learning </p><p>•\tAll tutorials would be sequenced in such a way, that it would make learning easy and simple. Building a smooth road for a non tech savvy artist, as everything would be available on just one click</p><p>•\tIt will help in building a community for artists, as there would be various activities like competitions, exhibitions conducted and hence art lovers from hook and corner of the country would be able to showcase their creativity, which will also help in promoting smaller artist</p><p>•\tIt will also serve as a platform for the talented artists of our country to share their knowledge and skills to a wider audience, covering pan India</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>Audience Benefit</p><p>•\tUsers will learn to draw and paint using different mediums, through various tutorials sitting right at home, which would add value to people who want to learn but don’t know how and where to start from and don’t have time to join classes. </p><p>•\tIt will be a cost-effective learning, and hence even the ones who can’t afford drawing classes will be able to master the art form they always wanted to</p><p>•\tMakes sense in the post covid world where people will spend more time home and need something to inspire themselves.</p>\n        ","industries":["Art & Photography"],"name":"Be Artistic","sectors":["Art"]},{"email":"amar@maptek.in","idea":"<p>SalesClap is a powerful cloud based software-as-a-service (SaaS) CRM provider for Real Estate industry in India.
