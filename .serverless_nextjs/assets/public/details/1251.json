Around 17 million people are at the risk of DFU which accounts for 1 lakh foot amputations per year.<div>Current assessment method is based on visual inspection by the doctor and is highly subjective.</div><div>Itâ€™s difficult to quantify and monitor healing progress of the wounds. This leads to lack of quality assessment, delay in diagnosis and high treatment costs.</div><div>We help doctors to monitors and predict the healing outcomes of ulcer.</div><div><br></div><div>The proposed innovation is low-cost portable assessment device which helps to quantify, monitor and predict healing potential of chronic wounds in diabetic patients through rapid, early screening for DFU and associated pathologies including infections and peripheral vascular disease. \n</div><div>The clinician will use the device to quantify, grade severity and monitor ulcer parameters. Grading will help in clinical assessment. Monitoring will help in tracking the effectiveness of treatment.\n</div><div>Our current technology can characterize wound tissue based on biological properties such as blood flow, tissue perfusion, and oxygen saturation at the wound surface to determine the healing progress and early prediction of healing outcome. Collected data can grade ulcer to understand servility of the DFU before it becomes infected or gangrene formed. \n</div><div>The device is connected to a tablet with custom software with various image processing techniques clubbed with cloud-based analytic model for data storage and analytics on the fly. \n</div><div>It will solve the problem of effective wound assessment in rural areas where there is a lack of experienced doctors.
