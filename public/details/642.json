[{"email":"shoreline.engineer@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Shoreline Engineers and Contractors India Private limited (SECI) will construct affordable steel fishing vessel with all latest technology which will increase Quantity and Quality of Fish Catch.</p><p><br></p><p>fishing  boat powered by  parallel Hybrid System, 12 meters long and 3.5 meters wide,  can carry 6 ton of catch fish and<b>   it will be the first of kind fishing boat in India </b>.The idea of the End User was to give fisherman a new way of fishing, putting together comfort and environment protection.</p><p><br></p><p>While traditional diesel propulsion, where a diesel engine directly drives the vessel’s propellers, has served the fishing  industry well for decades, this method of propulsion has inherent shortcomings that, in today’s highly competitive and environmentally conscious world, are becoming harder and harder for boat owners to live with.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest problem is that diesel engines operate efficiently only over a narrow range of speeds. Outside this speed range, fuel economy is poor and exhaust emissions increase. With direct-drive propulsion, the speed of the diesel engine must at all times match the speed of the vessel. This means that when, for example, the vessel is moving slowly – as is invariably the case in harbors and ports – the engine is constrained to run inefficiently.\n</p><p>The Boat is able to navigate silently in electric mode and if needed or permitted, in Diesel mode. It’s a true redundant propulsion System, which is good for safety. having two parallel power  sources, it gives twice as long as the range it was with the Diesel or the electric motor only. When it’s sailing in Diesel mode,  the battery can be recharged, thus extending the range in electric mode cruising.\n</p><p>This  success allows us to look positively to the future, regarding the development of innovative propulsion systems and the requirements of fishing market, which is increasingly conscious  about environmental friendly and comfortable solutions.</p><p><br></p>","industries":["Automotive"],"name":"SHORELINE ENGINEERS AND CONTRACTORS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Auto & Truck Manufacturers"]},{"email":"contact@tenthirty.in","idea":"<p>Mauka is an EdTech platform that aims to impart employability skills to students in colleges, skill training institutes, and ITIs.
