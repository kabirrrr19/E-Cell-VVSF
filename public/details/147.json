The procedure in today’s time in hospitals is extremely lengthy and tedious and some patients are not educated enough to understand about the submission of all the documents required in the hospital, so this organization basically works with the patients to ease the system procedure of the hospitals. This organization collects all the data and documents by communicating with the patients and submitting it to the hospital. It can be understood that they are easing the work of the hospitals by educating the patients and also helping the patients in a way because as be known hospitals in today’s time don’t have the sole purpose of just treating the patient without taking any record of the patient, the treatment has to be accompanied by the documents coming from the patient’s end in a stipulated time period. Sometimes the patient’s family members who accompany him/her, get worried and perplexed because arranging the documents instantly gets worrisome for them, in that situation KEVAT SEVA SETU LLP. intervenes and helps them, because why let the family members be in anxiety’s grip when they can be helped by educated, dedicated and sensitized individuals.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every year, the state launches schemes that look brilliant on paper but when it comes to the implementation, there is none. Similarly, in the hospitals with government schemes, hospital administration and piles of pending paper work, although a scheme is highly taken into consideration by the hospital staff or even KEVAT SEVA SETU LLP., fact of the matter is that it barely reaches its potential beneficiary in the hour of need. Having observed this, founder said “Logistics can only be carried out by a third party who is solely dedicated to getting the administration work, paper filing done and follow ups done.” Not just this, the expectation from the team is that it should be able to make swift decisions pertaining to the rules and maintain diligent strictness of the process.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><b><span><span>KEVAT SEVA SETU LLP.</span></span></b></p><div><b>LLP Identification Number: AAT-5348.</b></div><div><b><span>UDYAM AADHAR NO: -&nbsp;</span><span>UDYAM-MH-33-0059247.</span></b></div>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"KEVAT SEVA SETU LLP","sectors":["Healthcare Services"]},{"email":"grypmed@gmail.com","idea":"<p>GRYPMED is formed based on the principles of open communication, empowerment, trust, integrity, and giving back to the community, wherein registered office in Mumbai.\n</p><p>We bring together a rich experience across all domains of Engineering &amp; Technology, Pharmacy &amp; Medical.
