When a car arrives at a hotel lobby, the guest is asked to simply enter a phone number on an app instead of giving a paper ticket. The Guest gets an SMS with a virtual  token number. This takes away the need of a paper ticket. When a guest needs to check-out, he simply clicks a link or gives a missed call to a number. The valet gets a notification on the app to get the car. The car arrives just in time there by enhancing guest experience.

Today, students have myriad choices when it comes to higher education. At Kimyo Learning, we are keen to help students to make informed decisions without spending loads of money. The current college selection process is primarily driven by the image of the college, but very little information is available from the real users. Also, most of the solutions are full stacked offering at a very high price. By breaking it into the different component, we are offering choice to students to chose as per their need. We will be investing in technology to make user-friendly products so that the students can do most of the work themselves. \n\nInnovation\nWe are building a P2P platform where senior students (Mentors) coach/guide fellow students (Mentees). We will bring Mentors from different institutes on our platform. Mentees will have the option of looking at the Mentor profile and then seek guidance. We are also developing easy, cost-effective search tools to help students select their colleges as per their requirement.\n\nScalability\nThere are more than a million engineers that are graduating every year. And more than three hundred thousand Indian students are looking at the global universities to study abroad. There is a huge market for of Young Indians who need help in deciding the right college.

This new innovative storage technology is cheaper than a conventional warehouse, it has a quick set up time as compared to existing storage conditions, it is relocatable, it is scalable in size, it is tailor made as per size required and land available. We have the capability to store grains in bag for or bulk form making us the only storage solution which can offer both these grains storage methods. We have completed a successful pilot project in Andhra Pradesh and based on that we hope to expand this new innvoative technology all over India. (Have attached a performance certificate from Andhra Pradesh). India looses thousands of  Crores of Rupees \n due to its existing improper storage methods. With this new innovation we can save Crores of rupees for the country and take care of the grains and protect them from losses. Not only will this help the countries farmers, it will also help the GDP as grains will be protected and employment will be generated. We are an innovative product as this kind of storage solution does not exist in India with all the above mentioned features and we are an improvement in process as there is a process to store food grains in the country today, but we are improving the way the grains are stored.","industries":["Agriculture"],"name":"ADEL AGRO PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Agri-Tech"]},{"email":"jatin.paranjape@khelomore.com","idea":"Currently almost all of the academies / coaches operate offline, i.e. on paper.

Here we come in to picture where our Restaurant is open for service from morning 7 am and in 3 km radius we deliver within 15-20 minutes which is a big boon for the working house wife. Many school children’s while boarding school bus come to our restaurant along with their mother to take IDLI in their school tiffin which is our biggest validation and trust builder. \nBecause of this we are getting consistent repeat customers along with very good word of mouth awareness. This is clearly a service which is very unique and consumers are lapping it up.\n\nProcess innovation\n\nUnlike other chain restaurants who have central kitchen we are operating our restaurant business in an hub n spoke model; the advantage of which is being closer to the consumer due to which the food is fresh with less travel time.\nAll this has led to frugality in our operations and this shows in the unit economics which is breaking even. We have broken down the food preparation in to small bits of processes which even an untrained person can prepare without compromising on the quality and taste.\nDue to process simplification business has huge potential in scaling up","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"SWAMY&#039;S IDLI TIFFIN LLP","sectors":["Restaurants"]}]
