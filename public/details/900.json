Each product is a 100% unique, when you find your perfect “perpetual” accessory, its story is different from any other and becomes your tell. Every accessory is started as a billboard. We then hand-cut and craft unique designs to create our high-quality products. 90% of all advertising in India is on PVC and 18,000 tons of PVC flex banners are used every month. Experts say that since it is made of synthetic polymer, it is dangerous as it does not dissolve on its own, and the only solution is to burnt it. Burning of flex releases toxic gases heavier than air, creating a blanket leading to reduction of oxygen in the near vicinity. The harmful gasses released are cancer causing. In the current situation, there is an ever-increasing demand for flex banners as they are used for every occasion. We will acquire used PVC Flex banners from advertising agencies and make accessories like bag packs, tote bags, laptop sleeves and gym bags from the material. This will reduce the wastage of PVC and help create new products. Each product will be 100% unique, as the copying the same design is not possible. We also have contacted bag manufacturer and our prototype model is ready.</p>","industries":["Social Impact"],"name":"The Perpetual Co.","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"vijayleo1987@gmail.com","idea":"<p><a href=\"http://protossofttech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://protossofttech.com/</a><br></p>","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"PROTOS SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Application Development"]},{"email":"shakti.pollai@zapplocal.com","idea":"<p>ZappLocal is India's One of the leading AI Based Automated SEO n Mobile App Platform that creates your Website n App just by 15 mins n get it discovered through Multiple Search Engines.</p><p><br></p><p>For Healthcare Sector we also have an Automated Web n App Solution that make you connect through Social Media Paltform through an Automated Integration.</p>","industries":["IT Services"],"name":"ZappLocal Technologies Pvt LTD","sectors":["IT Consulting"]}]
