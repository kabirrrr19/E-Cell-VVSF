It's a first step to create a market for alternative banking for users. </a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.udhaarde.com/search.html\" target=\"_blank\">Worldwide consumers spend nearly 1.5 trillion USD in buying financial and non financial assets both movable and immovable. A major chunk of these assets does not contribute to wealth creation or an addition to users' portfolios that may return additional income in future. These are non-financial assets. In banking terms such assets are practically non valuable assets or non cashable assets and are usually termed worthless. Much of these assets are classified as recreational possessions. However merely being classified as an asset that cannot be easily converted into cash cannot define its worth. For example iPhone, luxury watches, cars and bikes serve a very useful purpose and are considered as status possessions with a good resale value in a pre-used market. Such assets don't hold a precise monetary value but are valuable or could at least be valuable for a certain period of time due to various factors coming into play like demand and supply, depreciation expiration of technology etc. but still technically the assets hold value which is why the retail price was determined. So it's not just cost of production and other factors that sets the value of an asset but another largely felt to be camouflaged deterrent is the future value of the asset where other factors come such as brand equity and goodwill. Such assets can serve as equals to other cash loanable assets for a short period of time at least. These assets have been majorly ignored, sidelined and unacknowledged primarily because of ignorance and unwillingness or non intent to accept as loanable. There has been no will from banks and institutional lenders to accept such assets as loanable not because of unreliability of assets or maintenance issues but simply i feel circumstantial, and so users are made to part ways with such assets.</a><br></p>\n        ","industries":["Finance Technology"],"name":"DARTAGNAN TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["P2P Lending"]},{"email":"vecotindia@gmail.com","idea":"<p>SolarWaterWorld India Private Limited in a joint venture with SolarWaterWorld AG will manufacture and sell solar-powered boats and yachts to customers in its targeted market. SolarWaterWorld India Private Limited is promoted by Mr Vineet Rawal, founder of Virtual Eco Technologies. Virtual Eco Technologies has over 25 years of experience and expertise in the field of Solar and Wind Energy business and have executed several projects all over Asia. Some of the projects have won World’s Best Project Awards from European agencies. \n</p><p>Virtual Eco Technologies has been engaged in developing solar-powered electric boats for the last 12 years. While we achieved success in mastering the technical competencies, we realized that we will benefit substantially by partnering with an established world-class manufacturer. While exploring different manufacturers across Europe and London, we came across SolarWaterWorld, Germany. After initial discussions with the SolarWaterWorld AG, the German company agreed to extend its full support to us by entering into Joint Venture to promote the business in India. This led to the genesis of SolarWaterWorld India Private Limited in 2014.\n</p><p>The main objective of SolarWaterWorld India is to design and manufacture solar-powered electric boats. These boats will be in multiple models ranging from 2, 5, 10, 25 &amp; 50 seating capacity. Apart from selling we also intend to enter into the leasing of these boats to the hospitality and leisure industry. \n</p><p>An exclusive agreement has been signed with a reputed boat builder in Goa to source our first few launch boats. At a later stage, once we get order volumes, we plan to have our own production facility in Boisar, 80 km from Mumbai. In future Indian unit will be the global hub for exporting all products worldwide including Germany. Having our own production unit will help us significantly in reducing our cost of procurement and increasing profits. Once the setup is ready, we will also diversify into retrofitting of existing petrol-driven fibreglass boats. Since they already have the boats, we will just replace the drive and solarise it. We see enormous potential in this refurbishment market. \n</p><p>All these boats will be manufactured in India with exclusive joint venture collaboration and support from SolarWaterWorld AG of Germany. The manufacturing in India will happen under the guidance and supervision of German Engineers. Since these boats run on solar power, they are clean, silent, pollution and noise-free. The power required to run each boat is generated onboard via solar power plant. As we are backed by German engineering, we will have an edge over competition in terms of quality as the German company brings with it the rich experience of operating successfully for the past 16 years. Close partnerships with German boat manufacturing company also enables us to offer excellent quality boats at reasonable costs.</p>","industries":["Green Technology"],"name":"SolarWaterWorld India Pvt Ltd","sectors":["Clean Tech"]},{"email":"jaisainathconfectioneryllp@gmail.com","idea":"<p>We are a start-up exploring an opportunity in manufacturing a product called star candy(a confectionery item) .The product though being available at a very low price but the volume involved will scale our start up to new heights.&nbsp;</p>","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"JAI SAINATH CONFECTIONERY LLP","sectors":["Food Processing"]},{"email":"manshazfacility@gmail.com","idea":"\n            <p>HOSPITALITY SERVICES, HOUSEKEEPING SERVICES, CATERING SERVICES,MANPOWER SUPPLY, EVEN MANAGEMENT, FACILITY MANAGEMENT, SOFTWARE SUPPORT, DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION.</p>\n        ","industries":["Human Resources"],"name":"MANSHAZ FACILITY SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Recruitment Jobs"]},{"email":"AZADJAINCO_CA@REDIFFMAIL.COM","idea":"<p>To establish manage and run online fitness training programmes that focuses on working out from personal premises, including using artificial intelligence as the personal trainer, fitness plans, nutritional insight and expert advice.<br>Further, to acquire, establish and maintain health care and slimming centers, gymnasiums to provide the services relating to weight loss and gain programmes, modem gadgetries, aerobics, yoga techniques and for general improvement health for clients.<br></p>","industries":["AI"],"name":"KRATOS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"npujari04@gmail.com","idea":"<p>To carry on the business to produce, treat, process, prepare, alter, develop, expose, edit, exhibit, make, remake, display, print, reprint, convert, duplicate, finish, buy, sell, run, import, export cine films, TV serials, advertising films, telefilms, documentary films etc. and to act as agent, broker, distributor, proprietor, owners of copyrights, audio rights, theaters, cinema halls, dubbing rights, cinema studio and film processing labs owners and to do all other incidental acts for the attainment of the aforesaid objects of the company and to promote, produce, represent, conducting, performance and exhibition of cinematograph or stereoscopic or colored or bioscope, pictures, films, operate as &amp; stage plays and other entertainment as the Company may from time to time think fit and to permit the Company's premises to be used for all or any of the above purpose and such other purposes as may be deemed expedient.</p>","industries":["Media & Entertainment"],"name":"Phantasy Film media pvt ltd","sectors":["Entertainment"]},{"email":"contact@yugtafed.com","idea":"<p>The Company is involved in upliftment of economical backward women and enabling them to do small scale business.</p>","industries":["Social Impact"],"name":"Yugta Federation","sectors":["NGO"]},{"email":"dsgtclasses@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Wanted to start an online venture in education field&nbsp;</p>","industries":["Education"],"name":"Edudata llp","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"jyosh.ai.solutions@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Integrated Agriculture Robot for automation of cotton cultivation&nbsp;</p>","industries":["Agriculture"],"name":"JYOSH AI SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Agri-Tech"]}]
