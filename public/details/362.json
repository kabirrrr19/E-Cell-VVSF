And I would also like to use the byproducts (water and heat) from hydrogen fuel cells in organic farming.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","industries":["Green Technology"],"name":"Digi-Green","sectors":["Clean Tech"]},{"email":"harshil@raykamalloys.com","idea":"<p>Incorporated in 2021, Raykam Alloys LLP ventures into reinventing the supply chains of Steel and Alloys Raw Material and Semi-Finished Products.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://raykamalloys.com\" target=\"_blank\">Learn More.</a></p>","industries":["Others"],"name":"RAYKAM ALLOYS LLP","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"shayaquehussain@gmail.com","idea":"<p><span>Sanitary napkin, a universally needed product,\nhas very low penetration in India and other developing countries, partly due to\nits high price and partly due to the tradition of using cheaper but unhygienic\nold cloth piece.
