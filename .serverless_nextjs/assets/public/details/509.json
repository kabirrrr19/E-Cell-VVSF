There are no proper rankings provided to the local schools and colleges although the IITs are ranked.</p><p>2. We have to search for every college and school and visit their web pages which consumes our time and internet.</p><p>3. Even if we prioritize one school/college then we have to visit other similar webpages to know : Fee structure, Total seats, inhouse quota available or not, if it is a school then which board it teaches (SSC, CBSE, ICSE) , if it is a college  then what was last years placement,  is it near to the station, etc etc.</p><p>*For all this we surf the internet a lot and then also we are not satisfied with the answers given there. We cannot ask our query to anyone ( yeah there are some apps like quora where we can ask but probability of getting an answer is very low).*</p><p>For higher studies if we want to go to other states then there are different entrance exams for different states.&nbsp;</p><p>Also the hostel details are not provided on the webpages.</p><p>For searching solution for all this we have to go the particular colleges which consumes our time and money.  There is no other way we can easily get all these information.&nbsp;</p><p>*So I want to make a app with an easy interface and</p><p>1. with one search we will get the best institution around us according to their ranks.</p><p>2. Their whole fee structure,  hostel information,  placement information,  information about the teaching staff, if it is nearer to a station or bus stop.</p><p>3. Also we will provide a question-answer section so that the people who have knowledge can share the valuable information .</p><p>4. Also we will have a news section which will update the users about new changes in education policy, lockdown like situations, reopening of schools and colleges.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*If there can be m-indicator app which show the information about trains,  if there is upstox which shows the information about stock market, then there should be an app which gives people a chance to choose the best institution around them and have a great future ahead.*</p><p>&nbsp;As all this goes as we expect then future updates will also have something like</p><p>1) Career guiding paths( what to prefer diploma/science, pharmacy/doctor, etc</p><p>2) it can also have a free aptitude test for different age groups so that they can check their IQ.</p><p>......Thanks.</p>","industries":["Education"],"name":"nEma","sectors":["Education Technology"]},{"email":"shilpagharve@gmail.com","idea":"This is Dr. Shilpa Gharve.
