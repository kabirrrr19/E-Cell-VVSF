We think the moment for our product is right, and would impact a vast majority of people aged between 10-17 (which have been shown to be the most interested in e-learning content, and the ones opened to new technology). Our purpose is to become the most used e-learning platform, as an intermediary between the existing and future e-learning platforms and worldwide users.\n</p><p>Growth rates for e-learning platforms. From accessing statistics related to a successful e-learning platform. we’ve observed some key factors:\n</p><p>● 94% of the audience is out there for the content, not the forums\n</p><p>● Estimated daily time on site: about 8-9 minutes\n</p><p>● Most of the visitors did not come from a search engine, but became loyal to the platform so they entered on this particular platform because they saw value in what it can offer. This offers a great deal of confidence that once you get the user to use your e-learning product, if it was a good experience, he will probably return and use it again\n</p><p>Our product over competition. Seeing that loyalty from the user is hard to get but once you do get it, it’s not hard to keep it once the user can find what he finds for. What we do by aggregating e-learning content and centralizing all meta-information about them in one place would determine users to use it as an intermediary most of the time when looking to learn something new. It may be very hard to override the user’s behavior of directly searching on a search engine for e-learning materials. We can overcome this difficulty by providing our users the best content aggregator, advanced content that would be hard to find directly through a search engine. Also, using a browser plugin to search directly in our aggregated e-learning material database would also help.\n</p><p>Objectives. Some of our objectives are:\n</p><p>● generate a lot of initial content from e-learning platforms like YouTube (somewhere in there), Instagram, vimeo (somewhere in there again) etc.\n</p><p>● have all the crawled data sorted out, by exploiting as much as we can the meta-data from videos, to be able so classify them by difficulty\n</p><p>● gather 100,000 unique visitors in Domestic Market and 100,000 worldwide\n</p><p>● create an interface and an API for e-learning platforms to use to simplify our work\n</p><p>Keys to Success. No doubt about the fact that the key to success is to offer the user the feel that it can trust our platform to help him/her improve ones skills, so that one can find it valuable enough to use it. This means we need to:\n</p><p>● offer vast content\n</p><p>● suggest the user some successful roads to follow in order to improve ones skills\n</p><p>● be reliable, no extended down times</p>","industries":["Education"],"name":"SMILEY CONFIDENCE ONLINE EDUCATION LLP","sectors":["E-learning"]},{"email":"nirlonhouseware@gmail.com","idea":"<p>NIRLON HOUSEWARE PRIVATE LIMITED is the leader in manufacturing of nonstick cookware and kitchen products that enable our customers to cook healthy, tasty food with convenience.</p>","industries":["House-Hold Services"],"name":"NIRLON HOUSEWARE PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"ajinnovator@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Greenox&nbsp; is an&nbsp; technology based company&nbsp; working in the area of Artificial intelligence and Machine learning to solve sustainability&nbsp; and waste management problem to contribute towards a&nbsp; full circular economy&nbsp;</p>","industries":["Waste Management"],"name":"Greenox ","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"krinashah0493@gmail.com","idea":"\n            <p>We are a software consultancy agency working with startups for building their systems.
