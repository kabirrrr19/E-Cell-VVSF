Their revenue flow is usually skewed/seasons or they generally acts as aggregators – in our case, the FPO that we work with collects milk but sells a huge chunk (90% of the total milk collected) to other dairies.\n</p><p>The real impact is when the FPO is able to make money out of value added products, trading of milk (raw materials) puts them in a very vulnerable position- milk has little or no shelf life, the variation i prices of milk is huge and there is a lot of variation in milk collection through the years. Also, the margins on trading of milk are quite thin. We are trying to help the FPO move from trading of milk to making revenues by making extremely high quality value added products without having to worry about the aspects like marketing, branding, logistics, packaging etc.\n</p><p>Talegaon Farms doesn’t need to build factories or invest in any other hardcore infrastructure. We try to fix the ones that already there – we make most of the resources\n</p><p>We are currently working with an FPO in Maharashtra to produce ghee as per the standards/guidelines set by us. The FPO owns majority of the supply chain - from manufacturing to packaging (we provide the packaging materials to the FPO).We, Talegaon Farms are responsible for building the brand, marketing and customer acquisition.</p>","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"MONTAGNA CREAMERY PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Food Processing"]},{"email":"varsha.malkani@cap-tech.in","idea":"<p>1.
