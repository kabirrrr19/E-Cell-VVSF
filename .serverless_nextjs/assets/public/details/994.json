Also we discovered that the cooking member of the family is very occupied with taking care of the entire needs of the family and it is a common practice where the the individual leaves the knob open/gas leakage problems which leads to explosion. We would like to address this problems with our flame safety devices installed in every cooktop.</p><p><br></p><p>Our project also includes in promoting the highly successful campaign of #giveitup launched by the Honb'le PM and make it reach to maximum houses that can afford this and also encourage the middle income groups to give up their subsidies on LPG cylinders through our marketing plan in the way of the same amount (as their LPG subsidy per year) to reach to the customer by the way of intensives hence having an almost zero effect of the customer when they give up their subsidy but in turn the government can use that amount for further development.</p><p><br></p><p>We also have designed a service method and with the help of technology offer genuine and very reasonable service to the customers for their any brand gas stoves.
