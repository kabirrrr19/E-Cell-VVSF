Leveraging these characteristics, Japan Dome House has used special technology to successfully infuse the material with sufficient strength for use as a building/structural material. Moreover, multiple treatments, including a fire-retardant finish and UV protection coating, have been used to make it more durable than regular expanded polystyrene\n</p><p>Safety- Expanded polystyrene is comprised solely of hydrogen and carbon and is formed in a mold using steam, so no hazardous substances are used to make it, and no dioxins are generated when it is burned. No formaldehyde is used, either, so there is no risk of sick building syndrome or other building related illness. This safe, reliable material is human-friendly and contains no harmful substances.\n</p><p>Environmental Friendliness- Expanded polystyrene does not place a significant burden on the planet at any stage from manufacturing to use. It offers energy savings through excellent thermal insulation and airtightness, resource saving through the ability to only make the required amount with molding, and global warming prevention through a fluorocarbon-free manufacturing process. Offering environmental friendliness, itâ€™s a futuristic new material.</p>","industries":["Construction"],"name":"weltretter projects and consultants private limited","sectors":["Construction Supplies & Fixtures"]},{"email":"siddharth@celebrityschool.in","idea":"<p>CELEBTEAM EDUCATION PRIVATE LIMITEDCELEBTEAM EDUCATION PRIVATE LIMITEDCELEBTEAM EDUCATION PRIVATE LIMITEDCELEBTEAM EDUCATION PRIVATE LIMITEDCELEBTEAM EDUCATION PRIVATE LIMITEDCELEBTEAM EDUCATION PRIVATE LIMITEDCELEBTEAM EDUCATION PRIVATE LIMITED</p>","industries":["Education"],"name":"CELEBTEAM EDUCATION PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["E-learning"]},{"email":"aksharteam.at@gmail.com","idea":"<p>I'm 17yo, Business Owner, I own a Web Development &amp; Marketing Agency.</p>","industries":null,"name":"Sahil Laheru","sectors":null},{"email":"karf.enterprises@gmail.com","idea":"<p>KARF Enterprises is specialized in providing quality CIVIL, INTERIORS and ARCHITECTURE services for the Hospitality, Residential, Corporate and Retail markets.</p>","industries":["Architecture Interior Design"],"name":"KARF Enterprises","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"hardik.dedhia@studyinfinity.in","idea":"We are an education technology company which is established in 2021 as an Studyinfinity Pvt.Ltd. at Thane , Maharashtra.
