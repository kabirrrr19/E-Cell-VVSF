This suggests</p><p>that more than 70 percent of the Indian population consumes meat. In recent</p><p>years, the start-up ecosystem has influenced a shift in the meat selling</p><p>business and captured a significant portion of the meat delivery market.</p><p>In India, however, the market for meat delivery is still dominated by</p><p>unorganised meat merchants, who control about 99 percent of the area. In</p><p>the past, people have purchased meat from local butcher shops, sacrificing</p><p>on quality and convenience. The majority of them are still unaware that meat</p><p>purchased from butcher shops is sold in an unsanitary way and is not fresh</p><p>and of poor quality. The meat offered in conventional butcher shops is</p><p>exposed to environmental contaminants and insects like flies.</p><p>There is no uniformity of price, quality, and freshness in the conventional</p><p>meat-selling sector.</p><p>The unorganised players adhere to an inefficient supply chain, which</p><p>decreases the quality of the products and renders them unfit for human</p><p>consumption. According to scientists, India's meat has the greatest</p><p>concentration of antibiotics. Low investments are made in both the meat</p><p>business and the rearing of cattle for meat production. Infrastructure</p><p>inadequacy is another key challenge.</p><p>In the last several years, urban customers have gradually shifted towards</p><p>purchasing meat online due to considerations such as convenience and the</p><p>ability to receive fresh and clean meat at their doorstep. Online meat-selling</p><p>startups have altered how India purchases meat. These companies provide</p><p>custom-cut, marinated, and ready-to-cook meat items, which is a blessing</p><p>for those who wish to have a non-vegetarian dinner at home without the</p><p>trouble of preparing it.</p><p><br></p><p>Doordash will prepare the meat in order to provide raw fish, chicken,</p><p>mutton, eggs, ready-to-cook food, spreads, MOMOs, and cold cuts (including</p><p>ham, salami, and sausage). The processing of meat helps to maintain its</p><p>freshness, convenience, appearance, palatability, and safety, and it also</p><p>offers customers a diverse selection of meat products from which to choose.</p><p>Not only do industries that process meat add value to the product and</p><p>lengthen its shelf life, but they also contribute to the efficient management</p><p>of quality, which allows for the production of meat and meat products that</p><p>are of higher quality at a lower price on a local level. Increasing the</p><p>availability of food at periods when it would not normally be accessible, so</p><p>helping to increase overall food security.</p><p><br></p>","industries":["Food & Beverages"],"name":"DOORDASH FOODS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Food Processing"]},{"email":"rubyraysinfratech.developers@gmail.com","idea":"<p>Rubyrays Infratech Developers Llp is a Limited Liability Partnership firm incorporated on 07 September 2021.</p>","industries":["Real Estate"],"name":"RUBYRAYS INFRATECH DEVELOPERS LLP","sectors":["Others"]},{"email":"hiteshjirawla@gmail.com","idea":"<p>AIProp Analytics Private Limited helps banks and non-banking financial institutions transform their property-due diligence process.
