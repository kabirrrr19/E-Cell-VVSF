We have miles to progress on multiple fronts in the healthcare eco-system, a few challenges where VVP can promise a solution are listed here:\n<div>\n</div><div>1.\tAs a country we have no visibility on the Disease outbreaks – we get to know the same when a large number of patients are already affected, or deaths have happened. Reason being - No visibility on prescriptions written across the country.\n</div><div><br></div><div>2.\tThe government has created a vast healthcare network which is dependent on the efficiency of the doctors deployed there and how well the healthcare facility is being utilized locally. The central or the state level healthcare administration never gets to gauge the efficiency of the local healthcare facility deployed as the central team has no visibility of the number of Prescriptions written or the time of the day prescriptions are written. \n</div><div><span></span><br></div><div>These issues are just the tip of the challenging iceberg and all are dependent on the visibility into the voluminous Prescription data. Imagine if we could assess the written Prescription data from each Doctor without having to force the Doctor to change their behavior of writing a Prescription or forcing them to use a specific EMR/EHR software.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>VVP Healthcare Evolution Pvt Ltd (hereinafter referred as WonDRx) for the first time in the country has created a unique solution. WonDRx is launching a Smart Prescription Pad which will digitize the prescription (Rx) written on the Rx paper by the doctor. No special software needed for Doctor, no learning or training needed – Doctor has been writing an Rx and he continues to write the Rx. We are able to digitize the written Rx without any additional effort or time. Additionally, WonDRx connects the entire healthcare eco-system which is needed to serve the doctor and their patients.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n<span>WonDRx brings enormous value to all the stakeholders in the Healthcare ecosystem:&nbsp;</span></div><div>\n</div><div>Doctors-Today doctors understand the value of digitizing the patient’s data but are unable to do so due to the need to change their behavior from writing to typing besides spending money on expensive software’s and accessories like laptop &amp; printers. Additionally, it takes away the eye contact and attention of doctors from patients to typing. Besides, there have been no innovation in the way the consultation is happening today in the clinic and the post clinic consultation connection between the patient and the doctor. Also, the doctor has no visibility on the post consult journey of the patient. With WonDRx we are able to solve all of these pain points for the doctors.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Patients- Patients overall have several pain points like- \n</div><div>•\tMonotonous way of receiving in-clinic Doctor consultation\n</div><div>•\tChallenges to find the best Healthcare provider like labs, chemists etc post prescription written by the doctor\n</div><div>•\tNo Digital health record available\n</div><div>•\tDoes not fully recall important Dr instructions post Doctor visit\n</div><div>•\tGets overload of Disease information with no contextual education given \n</div><div>With WonDRx patients will able to get all these value-added services.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n<span>Healthcare service Providers (chemists, labs, scan centers, physio etc)- Today the health care partners are unable to provide a unique experience to their customers and they do not have enough bandwidth to create a tech platform of their own. WonDRx will allow them to not just receive the patients lead directly from the doctors but also be in a situation to create a wow experience for the patients.&nbsp;</span></div><div>\n</div><div>Additional benefits of WonDRx\n</div><div>1.\tData insights will help innovation and research- WonDRx is the new age solution for healthcare ecosystem which brings in transparency, collaboration, innovation and it collates the Rx data for highly insightful decisions which are so much needed in creating an impactful healthcare eco-system, a healthy India. Even today we rely on research insights from the west. But our patients and the diseases impacting them are unique and we need to have our own solutions. That is lacking due to the lack of proper and large meaningful data. \n</div><div><br></div><div>2.\tApplicability across the developing world- The solution is usable across the world wherever Doctors are using Pen and Paper to write a Prescription. The solution has the capacity to scale across the developing economies in no time and India will set the leading example for all. \n</div><div>\n</div><div>WonDRx is building an integrated healthcare environment, a new experience across stakeholders and a scalable foundation for future healthcare innovation through WonDRx platform. WonDRx connects various stakeholders (Patients, Doctors, Post-Rx healthcare service providers, Pharma/Insurance companies etc) seamlessly and enables smooth transactions amongst the stakeholders while generating invaluable data insights. \n</div><div><br></div><div>WonDRx is about enhancing the experience, convenience, efficiency, intelligence across the spectrum of its deployment.</div>","industries":["Healthcare & Lifesciences"],"name":"VVP HEALTHCARE EVOLUTION PRIVATE LIMITED","sectors":["Healthcare Technology"]},{"email":"pushkar@vetcart.com","idea":"Company Profile:\n<div>url : www.vetstore.in\n</div><div>Industry : Animal Healthcare\n</div><div>Employee: 8\n</div><div>Founded : Dec 2015</div><div><br></div><div>Contact \n</div><div>Pushkar Panday\n</div><div>pushkar@vetcart.com\n</div><div>mob: 91 99304 94189</div><div><br></div><div>Anytime Vetstores Private Limited (ATVS)\n</div><div>\n</div><div>ATVS is a revenue generating aggregator of veterinary doctors &amp; clinics and presently provides services through Annual Membership through a combination of In- House Treatment, Clinic surgeries and Remote Medication.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Business Summary: Launched formally in May 2016, Vetstores has a network of Vet Doctors &amp; Vet Clinics across Mumbai and at present have attended and treated more than 6,000 Pets &amp; stray cases across Mumbai.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Why to do this: \n</div><div>\n</div><div>A)\tUndercapitalised and One size fits all Vet clinics (~60-70%) \n</div><div>B)\tMajority of Pet cases are best treated at Home\n</div><div>C)\tMost of the Vet practises needs Upgrade, Innovation &amp; Transparency\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Product / Services: \n</div><div>\n</div><div>A)\tPresent –ATVS provides systematic Pet Home Treatments and remote medical assistance to pet owners across Mumbai through annual membership.
