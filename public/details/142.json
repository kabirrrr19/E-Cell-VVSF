While technology is constantly evolving to make it easy to connect with strangers, it lacks within it an inherent incentive to do so. It is why all popular digital connectivity platforms lean towards connecting you with friends, colleagues and contacts you already know.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>Networking events built around common interests, common experiences do bring strangers together. However, few connections are formed and fewer last towards an impactful long term exchange of support. Vishal and Mohit met at one such event exploring their interest in design and marketing. While they found common ground, their journey from networking to partnering involved years of passive connectivity and build up of trust. They saw an opening in the networking industry. They realised the extreme lack of incentive for people to help beyond their existing circles.
