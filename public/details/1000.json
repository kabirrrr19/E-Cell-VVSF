The facility will be designed such that all fixed and variable costs including plant machinery, utilities, manpower, consumables etc will be kept at a minimum.  The solar waste material will be collected from module manufacturers, project owners and test labs.  These waste generators are expected to pay a disposal fee for recycling similar to what they are paying now for simply disposing into landfill.  Recovered materials like glass, aluminum, copper, silicon, silver   will be sold to respective buyers.  A 500 TPA recycling unit is expected to generate a revenue of about INR 4 Crores per year. Resha Tech will start with an initial capacity of 500 TPA and slowly build capacity to reach 5000 TPA by 2025.  With further expansion through multiple recycling plants at strategic locations around the country we plan to build a total capacity of 20,000 TPA by 2030.  With our current estimate of revenue generated from sale of recovered materials and disposal fees, a 500 TPA plant will generate revenue of INR 4 Crores in 2020 reaching 40 Crores by 2025 and reaching 160 Crores by 2030 with a plan of 20,000 TPA.","industries":["Renewable Energy"],"name":"Dr. Sarita Zele","sectors":["Renewable Solar Energy"]},{"email":"aakashmokal1406@gmail.com","idea":"<p>FOODIES FAMILY is a small home based food delivery service owned by a son and mother.
