[{"email":"stuti@swapfashions.com","idea":"<p>Swap Fashions was founded in 2020 to solve the problem of excessive consumption created due to fast fashion and to reduce the carbon footprints of the fashion industry. Swap Fashions’ sole aim is to help women de-clutter and update their closets while not discarding the clothes into a dump. We encourage and facilitate swapping of preloved clothes via our platform.  Women can also thrift preloved clothing from Swap Fashions in case they do not have clothes to trade-in for swapping. At Swap Fashions, we aim to get every urban person (in the middle/upper-middle-income group) to have at least one swapped/ thrifted outfit in their closet by the end of 2025.</p>","industries":["Fashion"],"name":"Swap Fashions","sectors":["Apparel"]},{"email":"rajesh@goodgovern.com","idea":"<p>Good Governance and why it matters</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>Desirous of building the long-term sustainability of business and driven by the demands of their stakeholders, progressive organisations are transitioning to a new normal and moving beyond mere compliance to elevating their governance models to encompass environmental, social, equity, transparency, impact other broader governance parameters. We support organisations hasten their journey from Governance to ‘Good Governance’ by offering comprehensive advisory services focused on building a sustainable “Business-India”.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>&nbsp;About us</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>We believe that good governance goes beyond mere compliance and is the key to impactful and long-term growth for any organisation - large or small. We help Boards reimagine how they will be organised and how work will get done.  We aim to work with organisational leadership to increase their governance effectiveness and translate their vision into meaningful metrics across the organisation.\n</p><p>We are an ecosystem of consultants, practitioners and partner companies from diverse fields such as corporate, government, social sector and start-ups, drawn together with a determination to significantly alter the way governance processes and practices are engineered in corporate India. \n</p><p>The GoodGovern Approach\n</p><p>Our approach is rooted in understanding the regulatory environment, governance processes, human behaviour, organisational culture, and industry context. This is further enhanced by academic research rigour and the collective experience of many leaders in our advisory board. We bring these elements together to set a realistic baseline and arrive at a clear understanding of where an organisation lies on the governance curve and where it wishes to be.\n</p><p>We work with the Board and company leadership to leverage existing frameworks and build out new capabilities, goal setting and metrics to future proof the organisation's execution flexibility and strategic agility so that the journey towards good governance continues steadily and visibly.\n</p><p>Our 4 Pillar framework spans four aspects of the organisation to co-create and implement a governance framework that is process-oriented, practical and achievable.\n</p><p>&nbsp;A.
